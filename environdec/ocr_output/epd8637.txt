4.5 Cut-off criteria

The study does not exclude any modules or processes which are stated mandatory in the EN
15804:2012+A2:2019 and the applied PCR. The study does not exclude any hazardous materials or
substances.

This is a cradle to gate EPD. The product is exempted of declaring modules C1-C4 and D becausse it
fullfils the 3 conditions stated in EN 15804. End of life scenarios can be found in EPD for concrete and
mortar.

The study includes all major raw material and energy consumption. All inputs and outputs of the unit
processes, for which data is available for, are included in the calculation. There is no neglected unit
process more than 1% of total mass or energy flows. The module specific total neglected input and
output flows also do not exceed 5% of energy usage or mass.

4.6 Allocation, estimates and assumptions

Allocation is required if some material, energy, and waste data cannot be measured separately for the
product under investigation.

In this study, as per EN 15804, allocation is conducted in the following order;
1. Allocation should be avoided.

2. Allocation should be based on physical properties (e.g. mass, volume) when the difference in revenue
is small.

3. Allocation should be based on economic values.
In this study allocation is made by mass.

Allocation used in Ecoinvent 3.6 environmental data sources follows the methodology ‘allocation, cut-
off by classification’. This methodology is in line with the requirements of the EN 15804 -standard.

4.7 Averages and variability
The values are a weighted average of the two production sites. The variabiity is less than 5%
48 Manufacturing and packaging (a1-a3)

The environmental impacts considered for the product stage cover the manufacturing of raw materials
used in the production.

In this stage, we consider as raw materials clinker, gypsum, limstone, fly ashes, slag and pouzzolana
and additive. We do not consider packaging material as the dispatch is done by truck.

The electricity used is coming from the national network.
The water is used in a closed circuit and is allocated to clinker production.

Waste in the cement blending and crushing process are recirculated inside tha factory.

potential. 2) EN 15804+A2 disclaimer for Abiotic depletion and Water use and optional indicators except Particulate matter and lonizing
radiation, human health. The results of these environmental impact indicators shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these results
are high or as there is limited experienced with the indicator. 3) Required characterisation method and data are in kg P-eq. Multiply by 3,07

4) SQP = Land use related impacts/soil quality. 5) EN 15804+A2 disclaimer for lonizing radiation, human health. This impact category deals
mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not consider effects due to
possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation
from the soil, from radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.

5.2 Information on biogenic carbon content

There is no biogenic carbon in this cement.

6 Additional information

Prolonged physical contact with non-low chromate cements can cause allergic skin reactions. The limit
of chromium VI content to be considered as low chromate content is 2mg/kg
