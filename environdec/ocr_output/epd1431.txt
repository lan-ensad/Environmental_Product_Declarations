Holcim Solutions and Products Spain commitment with sustainability is shown by its
environmental policy and vision which is based in the following principles:

Envisioning a sustainable future
In harmony with nature

Value natural resources

Reduce CO2 and other emissions

Holcim Solutions and Products Spain (Holcim) plant in Terrassa is also certified with ISO
14001:2015. Initiating Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) process for its products, non-
reinforced EPDM membranes for waterproofing (for roofs, lining pondlining, lining agricultural
and facades), will be able to present the environmental performance most transparently with
EPD documentation. Thus, Holcim engaged inèdit (Inèdit Innovacié SL) to evaluate the
environmental profile of its Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) membrane products,
manufactured in C/Libra 17, Poligon Industrial Can Parellada, Terrassa, Spain, using Life Cycle
Assessment (LCA) and to report the results in Environmental Product Declarations (EPD) for

communication to third parties.

3. LCA INFORMATION

The primary goal of this study is to assess the cradle-to-gate with options of the environmental
impacts of “non-reinforced EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) membranes for
waterproofing” manufactured by Holcim Solutions and Products Spain.

The LCA has been performed following the PCR “2012:01 Construction products and
construction services” version 2.2 (The International EPD System, 2012:01), ISO 14040 (ISO
14040, 2006), ISO 14044 (ISO 14044, 2006), ISO 14025 (ISO 14025, 2010) and EN 15804 +A1
(UNE-EN 15804, 2012). The life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) categories and other indicators
considered to be of high relevance to the goals of the project are listed in this chapter.

Table 2 presents the product characteristics and the declared unit and references service life
used in the LCA.

3.1.General System Boundaries

This approach is a “cradle to gate with options” and the stages consider are presented in Table
3. As there is not a specific sub-PCR for products under the scope of this study, the company has
chosen to declare the EPD as a “cradle to gate with options” with a Declared Unit.

1 The reference service life used is the one proposed by the PCR Flexible membranes for waterproofing - bitumen,
plastic or rubber membranes for roof waterproofing (expired 2017-07-10; replaced).

3.3.Geographical and time boundaries

This study represents Holcim’s EPDM flexible membrane manufacturing facility in Poligon
Industrial Can Parellada, Terrassa, Spain. It also considers the plant in Polinyà, Barcelona, where
part of the process takes part and because part of the distribution leaves from there. The
geographical coverage for this study is based in the EU. Production of the membranes occurs in

7
Spain and the installations and end of life are evaluated for Spain and the rest of the EU. Spain
and European data are used in the first place and if missing global data will be used.

The primary data related with the production is from year 2017. Background data for upstream
and downstream processes (i.e. raw materials, energy resources, transportation and ancillary
materials) are to be obtained from primary data or from databases (Ecoinvent v3.2 database)
and the time boundaries will depend on the process used. Specific data from the real process
has been used for all raw and ancillary materials, energy consumption, waste production and
emissions to air, soil and water. The electricity production used for the calculations is from the
average and renewable mix for 2017 in Spain and is explained in Annex II.

3.4.Cut-off criteria

The cut-off criteria for flows are described in the PCR 2012:01 and in EN 15804. AI inflows from
the upstream (A1) and core modules (A2-A3) are included and for some of the downstream
stages (A4-A5; B1 and C1-C4). All available energy and material flow data have been included in
the model. In cases where no matching life cycle inventories were available to represent a flow,
proxy data have been applied based on conservative assumptions regarding environmental
impacts. The assumptions of the key processes used in the life cycle inventory and results are
described in Annex |.

3.5. Software, allocation rules and data quality

The LCA model was created using an excel calculator, Simapro and Gabi software and Ecoinvent
V3.2 LCA database.

As several products are manufactured at the same plant (EPDM for roofing, for lining, facades
or other uses), Holcim used mass allocation to report data. Mass allocation was selected since
the environmental burden in the industrial process (energy consumption, emissions, etc.) is
primarily governed by the mass throughput of each sub-process.

Data from the production process by Holcim is measured as primary data. This data is of the
highest precision, followed by calculated data, literature data, and estimated data. Each input
and output of the LCA performed has a related description for the origin of the data and
assumptions on the data used in the excel calculator. More information on data quality and a
sensitive analysis has been carried on in LCA report.

4. LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY ANALYSIS

Primary data for the manufacturing of non-reinforced EPDM membranes for roofing, lining
pondiining, lining agricultural and facades were collected from the Terrassa and Polinyà plants.
Data were provided from Holcim for the 2017 calendar year.

The environmental performance includes any activity within the “cradle to gate” with options
and is reported separately by the modules of life cycle stages listed below and represented in
Figure 2.

Dutput B10. Emissions

A description of the life cycle of the product related with each stage of the LCA is made below:

(A1) The main material input into the manufacturing process is EPDM mix in form of uncured
compound and (A2) is provided mainly by two suppliers. (A3) When arrived at Terrassa plant the
mix is heated, stirred and extruded into a profile. The membrane is then pressed by calendering
to achieve the specified thickness, cooled, cut and rolled up along with protective polyamide
sheeting. EPDM scrap generated during the before-mentioned steps can be directly looped back
as a material input, before the subsequent curing process that alters the rubber material
irreversibility, making it unfit as a scrap input. Curing entails to roll the membrane and wrapped
it to create pressure and placed in an oven. Once cured, the membrane maintains its shape and
size. The finished product is cooled in the rollers and separated from the polyamide. Part of the
final product need to be in a broader shape to sell (not for facades) and this process is made in
Polinyà plant. (A3T) For this it is needed a transport between Terrassa and Polinyà plants and
another step were some membranes are joined with EPDM strips and have a localized
vulcanization before packaging. (A3P) Part of the personalization is made in Terrassa and some
in Polinyà. The personalization of the rolls for customers is made by rolling the membranes in a
cardboard tube and wrapped with raffia. The packaging also requires labels, adhesive tapes,
straps, rubber separators, film, DM and boxes depending on the final use for the preparation for
transport. (A30) During the finishing and packaging process the generated waste is treated by
recycling, energy recovery, incineration or landfill. (A4) EPDM for roofing, lining pondlining,
lining agricultural and facades is then placed in pallets and distributed to the client from both
plants. This analysis assumes that the non-reinforced EPDM membrane is installed in roofing
and facades with synthetic adhesive, and manual installation for the other uses.

The inputs for use stages (B modules) for the EPDM membranes in this study are not included.
Still outputs of the system have been considered as there are emissions related with the use
phase and waste from the unpacking (B10).

The product has a Reference Service Life of 30 years and at the end of the membrane’s useful
life, the membrane is assumed to be sent to energy recovery, material recovery or landfill and
the other components are recycled, incinerated and landfilled assuming average data for Europe
related with waste treatments (C2-C4).
