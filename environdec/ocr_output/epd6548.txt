Description of the organisation: Holcim is one of the world leaders in building materials and
solutions with activity in four business segments: cement, aggregate, concrete solutions and
products in the field of construction. Its ambition is to lead the industry towards reducing
carbon emissions and moving towards low carbon construction. With the strongest R&D area
in the industry, the company seeks to promote the development and marketing of high-quality
and sustainable building materials and solutions for its customers around the world.

Holcim has five cement factories in Spain with an installed capacity of seven million tons per
year, 20 concrete plants, a mortar plant, a plant for the preparation of alternative fuels from
waste, four terminals and two distribution centers, where about 700 employees work. The
company is distinguished by having the first Laboratory with an exclusive area of alternative
fuels and the first Research and Development Center for New Concrete and Mortars. Holcim
contributes to global development by making significant efforts in innovation, which
materialize in the creation of safe, sustainable and high-performance materials and solutions
that respond to customer challenges

Product-related or management system-related certifications:
Holcim has implemented ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 management systems.

Name and location of production site(s):

Since the products included in the EPD are new in the market, primary data related to product
composition has been gathered from first production tests in 2020. The results are valid for the
product produced in all the manufacturing plants of Holcim in Spain.

Product information

Product name: ECOPact Prime: H35, H35 AGILIA and ULTRA SERIES PROYECTADO

Product description: Holcim is a leading manufacturer and supplier of high quality concrete
and mortar, and has projects and activities on road and network, collective housing.

Concrete and mortar production is a specific process: depending on the nature and quantity of
each of the components (cement, aggregates, water, additives), it will have different
characteristics. Once manufactured, the ready-mixed concrete/mortar is a fresh product, which
must be transported and used quickly on local markets, and under optimal conditions.

Holcim's concrete and mortar offer an outstanding combination of product quality and

performance. All manufactured products are high quality concrete and mortar, characterised
by their extraordinary capacity and great finishing.

PAGE 3/18
’HOLCIM = PD'

Products are a ready-mix concrete/mortar, as well as that the ranges included are structural
concretes, except Ultra Series Proyectado which is intended application is on flooring and
paving.

UN CPC code: 375 Articles of concrete, cement and plaster.

LCA information

Functional unit: One m3 of ready-mix of concrete/mortar which fufills the requirements of
technical performance for construction for a reference service life of 100 years. Ready-mix
concrete for structural applications has a strength of 35 MPa, while ready-mix concrete for
surface paving must be applied with a dosage of 450 kg/ms.

e For product references that have MPa: the intended use is structural.

e _Forthe product references that do not have MPa: the intended use is in paving and flooring
systems (those do not have the "strength" data, in MPa, because they are not structural and
are not characterised by their compression).

Reference service life: 100 years (as functional by the manufacturer) and recommended in c-
PCR for structural concrete.

Time representativeness: the data inventory of the LCA study presented is a new product and
data for a complete year is not available yet. The residual electricity mix is from Spain in 20182.
The amount used of raw materials (cement, water, gravel stone) has been obtained from the
recipe and first tests in Papiol, Valencia and Alcobendas manufacturing plant in 2020. Energy
consumption, waste production, pollutant emissions and transport distance (in A2 and A4)
have been obtained from Alcobendas, Valencia and Papiol manufacturing plants in 2019 (from
the first of January 2019 to the 315 of December 2019) since the production process is the
same for the different concrete products manufactured in the plants. The composition of the
specific cement used for each product has been obtained also directly from the manufacturing
plants and therefore correspondés to reality.

Database(s) and LCA software used: generic data on the impact per unit of matter or energy
have been taken to determine emissions per kg of matter, KWh of energy or tkm transported.

*This indicator includes all greenhouse gases in Total Climate Change but excludes removals and emissions of biogenic carbon dioxide as well as biogenic carbon stored in the product. Therefore,
this indicator is almost the same as the GWP indicator originally defined in EN 15804:2012+A1:2018.

Interpretation of results

As we can see in Table 6 and Figure 4, the product stage (A1-A3) is the life cycle stage with
the greatest impact for all the impact categories analyzed, representing between 95%
(Eutrophication freshwater) and 70% (Ozone layer depletion) of the total impact of the product
life cycle.

The module (A4-A5) represents an intermediate impact for all the impact categories analyzed.
Transport (A4) represents between 0,021% (Eutrophication, marine) and 2,3% (Ozone
depletion) of the total life cycle impact. On the other hand, A6-Installation stage represents 2%
of the total impact for all impact indicators.

In relation to End of life stages (C1-C4), the impact of C1 is between 18% (Eutrophication,
terrestrial) and 1% (Eutrophication, freshwater). C2 Transport represents between 3%
(Eutrophication, freshwater) and 17% for Photochemical ozone formation. Finally, C4 Waste
treatment represents an impact from 0,01% for abiotic depletion mineral and 1,2% for
Eutrophication, marine.

Additional information

With the aim of achieving a positive contribution to nature and society, we develop our activity
based on principles of sustainable development, through continuous improvement in our
environmental behaviour and focused on these four fundamental principles: our Management
System, control environmental impact, contribution to the circular economy and transparent
relationship with the environment.

Holcim Spain has registered its carbon footprint in section a) of the Carbon footprint and
commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for the years 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and
2020.

The limits of the organization included in the calculation are: cement, concrete and mortar
manufacturing activity carried out in all its facilities in Spain, central offices in Madrid and 63
production centers

Our commitment to the circular economy as the main way to take advantage of the
waste life cycle

The transition from a linear economy to a circular economy is one of the environmental
priorities of our business. Within our activity, our objective is to reuse the value of waste as
resources, that is, to maximize its life cycle.

At Holcim, we achieve the transition to circularity by complementing the activity of Geocycle,
a subsidiary of the Group that is dedicated to the pre-treatment of waste to turn it into fuel,
and the cement factories that use it in their clinker production process (component cement
base).

Proactive restoration of our quarries

At Holcim we have been working, for more than 30 years, for the restoration of our quarries
with the aim of generating a net positive impact on biodiversity. We are committed to a
participatory model of quarry rehabilitation in which the increase of biodiversity and natural
capital is favoured.

Our restoration model serves as a lever for change on the critical problem of biodiversity loss
and its potential to reverse its current negative trend. This work, key when it comes to creating
shared value with the communities in which we operate, has been recognized in 2018 with the
first second prize in the "Company and Biodiversity" category in the latest edition of the
European Business Awards for the Environment , promoted by the Biodiversity Foundation.

Differences versus previous versions

This version of this DAP presents a modification of its initial version dated 03-08-2022 due to an
editorial change as a result of the change in the name of the company and the change in the
name of the product, none of the parameters specified therein being affected.

Thus, where LafargeHolcim España previously appeared, Holcim España now appears (name
and logo).
