Programme information and verification

An Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) is a standardised way of quantifying the potential environmental impacts of a product or system. EPDs
are produced according to a consistent set of rules - Product Category Rules (PCR) -— that define the requirements within a given product category.
These rules are a key part of ISO 14025 as they enable transparency and comparability between EPDs. This EPD provides environmental indicators for
Humes steel-reinforced concrete drainage pipes manufactured at Blacktown in Australia. This EPD is a “cradle-to-gate with options (A1-A3, A4, A5),
modules C1-C4, and module D" declaration covering production, distribution, and end-of-life. Information regarding the installation and use of pipes
is provided in the section “Other environmental information". This EPD is verified to be compliant with EN 15804. EPDs of construction products may
not be comparable if they do not comply with specific requirements, as per the disclaimer on the previous page. Holcim (Australia) Pty Ltd, as the EPD
owner, has the sole ownership, liability, and responsibility for the EPD.

Introduction

riumes

Product description

As the leading manufacturer of reinforced concrete
pipes (RCPS) and associated precast products in
Australia, Humes pipes are available in a wide range
of diameters, lengths and load and exposure classes
with varying applications.

The primary application for RCP is for non-pressure
stormwater drainage pipelines. Other uses for our
RCP products are in sewerage and pressure pipe
applications, or as jacking and shaft components of
access chambers. Suitability in these conditions is
project specific. Further details on product use and
design for different applications can be found in
Humes' Concrete pipe reference manual (see
www.humes.com.au).

RCPs are made from coarse and fine aggregates,
cement, water, and hard-drawn deformed steel
reinforcement. Other materials used can include
supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) and
chemical admixtures which have varied effects on
the concrete depending on the admixture used.

RCPs are manufactured with varying joint types,
including the two most common basic joint types -
Flush Joint (FJ) and Rubber Ring Joint (RRJ) - to our
jacking pipe and shaft range.

FJ pipes provide an interlocking joint which allows
for a small degree of flexibility in the pipeline
alignment. RRJ pipes, either belled-socket or in-wall
joint depending on the diameter of the pipe andits
application, are designed to accommodate change
in pipeline alignment and settlement in a pipeline
whilst still maintaining a watertight joint.

Figure 2 - Schematic of steel cage in a RRJ
concrete pipe

The majority of Humes’ pipe is manufactured in 2.44
metre effective lengths in the DN300 to DN2100
diameter range. Effective length is used to define an
RCP's length as the physical length of the pipe
includes the overlap of the joint. The standard
effective lengths vary slightly at vertical cast
factories due to manufacturing limitations. Other
lengths and diameters of pipe can be manufactured
to suit project requirements. RCPSs are available in
standard-strength (class 2-4) and super-strength
(class 6-10).

Product composition

The product as supplied is non-hazardous. The products included in this EPD do not contain any substances of
very high concern (SVHOC) as defined by European REACH regulation* in concentrations >0.1% (m/m).

Dust from this product is classified as Hazardous according to the Approved Criteria for Classifying Hazardous
Substances 3rd Edition (NOHSC 2004). Precast concrete products and pipes are classified as non-dangerous
goods according to the Australian Code for the Transport of Dangerous Goods by Road and Rail. When concrete
products are cut, sawn, abraded or crushed, dust is created which contains crystalline silica, some of which may
be respirable (particles small enough to go into the deep parts of the lung when breathed in), and which is
hazardous. Exposure through inhalation should be avoided.

RCPs form part of the UN CPC 375 — “Concrete” industry classification and the ANZSIC 2034 — "Concrete Product
Manufacturing” product group classification.

All raw materials used in the production of RCP comply
with the following standards as required by AS 4058:

e AS 3582 Supplementary cementitious materials
Parts 1, 2 and 3 Supplementary cementitious

e AS 1646 Elastomeric seals for waterworks
purposes

Transportation - Module A2

Raw materials are typically transported to site via rigid
or articulated trucks. The impact of transportation is
determined from the specific supply sources for the
manufacturing site.

Manufacturing - Module A3

The manufacturing process of RCP at Blacktown is a
centrifugal spun process in the majority of Humes’ pipe
factories. Concrete is poured inside a spinning mould
where the water in the concrete is slowly drawn to the
interior of the pipe. Once the mould is filed with
concrete the bore of the pipe is smoothed and the
compaction process is complete.

RCP is cured in a curing chamber designed to accelerate
the setting and strength gain of the pipes immediately
after casting. Once RCPs have cured enough to be
handled with lifting equipment, they are transferred to
the outdoor yard storage area and continue to cure until
they are transported to the installation site.

Transportation - Module A4

Average distribution distances vary from site to site.
Transportation to the construction site is based on the
weighted average delivery scenario for RCP products

by site. Return-transport is empty.

Table 4: Transport to site parameters

Installation - Module A5

The installation of RCPSs in a storm-water system is
included in the LCA on the basis of a typical scenario.
This EPD contains a range of scenarios as the
installation scenario can have a significant impact on
the environmental profile. Only trench type installation
was considered due to the predictability of trench
dimensions. The type of support is selected depending
on the application (required performance) of the
pipeline system. The required strength of a concrete
pipe depends on both the load to be carried by the
installed pipe, and the supporting ground installation
conditions.

Installation processes include:

- Excavation of the trench
-* Placement and compaction of bedding materials
-* Placement of RCP

- Filing of the trench

Transport of imported and surplus materials is also
included as per the installation scenarios. The values
are expressed per metre of RCP of a particular
diameter, regardless of the class of pipe or whether the
pipe is made using the spun or dry-cast process. The
environmental impacts correlate strongly to the pipe
diameter.

Bedding types for pipes are H1, H2, HS1, HS2, HS3, and
U. Where U denotes an unsupported fill, H denotes
Haunch support, HS denotes Haunch and Side support,
and 1, 2, and 3 denotes the level of support
(compaction of fill) in the material used, see Figure 4.
Further details are available in AS/NZS 3725: Design for
Installation of Buried Concrete Pipes.

Further information on trench dimensions for the
installation of RCP can be found in Humes’ Concrete
pipe reference manual (see www.humes.com.au).

Use Stage

Pipework which is installed correctly is relatively inert and does not consume energy or water to operate. As
such, the life-cycle modules for use (B1), maintenance (B2), repair (B3), replacement (B4), refurbishment (B5),
operational energy use (B6), and operational water use (B7) are not declared.

Note regarding Repair and Replacement - Modules B3 and B4

Based on anecdotal evidence, in our original RCP EPD (S-P-00998) we conservatively assumed that 1% of pipes
require repair or replacement over a 100-year period. This was split evenly into 0.5% of pipes requiring repair
and 0.5% of pipes requiring replacement.

Repair of RCP involves injecting an epoxy resin into cracks that exceed 30 cm in length and/or are greater than
0.15 mm wide (BCC 2016). Smaller cracks are assumed to re-seal under the natural action of the concrete's
autogenous healing process. The impact of repair was shown to be marginal only.

Replacement of RCP involves impacts associated with all the other life cycle stages: product stage (A1-A3),
transport to site (A4), installation (A5), and end-of-life (C1-C4).

End of life stage

At the end of their functional life, RCP pipes can enter
into various disposal options. The two most likely
scenarios are:

e  leftin the ground, abandoned

° _exhumed and recycled

This EPD covers two options for the end-of-life stage, so
that the reader can select the applicable scenario for
their situation.

Deconstruction/Demolition - Module C1

When pipes are left in-ground, there is no activity
attributed to module C1. In the recycling scenario, it is
assumed that when the pipe is exhumed it is replaced
with another new product, the excavation and back-
filling of the trench is part of the next pipe's life cycle
and is not included in the replaced pipe's end-of-life
scenario. Removal of pipes is included.

Transport - Module C2

When pipes are left in-ground, there is no activity
attributed to module C2. In the recycling scenario,
the transportation includes taking the discarded
pipe to a recycling site or transportation of waste to
a final sorting yard or disposal site.

Waste Processing - Module C3

The waste processing includes crushing of waste
pipes (recycling) into concrete rubble and steel
scrap.

Disposal - Module C4

Waste disposal includes physical pre-treatment and
management of the disposal site. For pipes that are
left in-ground, emissions from concrete waste
disposed to landfill are considered. Pipes that are
left in the ground are assumed not to need any
further waste processing.

#** We assumed abandoning pipes equals landfilling (Disposal concrete 5% water, to inert material landfill/CH U/AusSD UV

minus energy used for management of the landfil! site).

*#*# The process relates to the removal of the pipe (excluding digging ofthe trench), where we conservatively assumed digging
one m3 equals removing one tonne of pipe. This approach assumes that (if the pipe is removed at end of life) à new pipe will
be installed (je. as part of an upgrade or replacement rather than removal). The excavation is considered part of module A5
{ofthe next life cycle) and as such it has not been double-counted in module CT of this life cycle.

Reuse, recovery, recycling potential - Module D

The information in module D includes environmental benefits or loads resulting from recyclable materials
leaving a product system. The concrete rubble and steel scrap produced in module C3 can replace natural
coarse aggregates (crushed rock) and virgin steel (after further processing), respectively. Module D is only
relevant when pipes are exhumed and recycled.

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Methodology

Background Data

Primary data covers the 2022 calendar year and has
been sourced from each of the Humes factories that
manufacture RCP. The life cycle model has been built in
SimaPro software v9.5.0.0.

Data for cement has been sourced from our supplier's
EPD (EPD S-P-07449).

Data for reinforcing steel wire is based on our supplier's
EN 15804+A1 compliant EPDs (S-P-00855 and S-P-
00858). To calculate the EN 15804+A2 indicator results,
ecoinvent v3 ("Reinforcing steel {RoW}] reinforcing steel
production | Cut-off, U") data have been used, and
GWP-GHG and ADP-fossil indicators have been
adjusted to align with the published EPD. Our second
supplier of reinforcement steel does not have an EPD.
We have used ecoinvent v3.9.1 data without adjustment
to model this steel. Data for steel that we use to make
jacking pipe collars are sourced from our supplier (EPD
S-P-00557).

Data for admixtures has been sourced from three EPDs
published by EFCA (European Federation of Concrete
Admixtures Associations) (EFCA 2021a, 2021b, 2023).
Other background data is predominantly sourced from
AusLCI and the AusLCI shadow database v1.42. Primary
data is less than five years old as at the date of
publication. Background data used is less than 10 years
old or has been reviewed within this period.

Methodological choices have been applied in line with
EN 15804:2012+A2:2019 deviations have been
recorded.

Allocation

The processes and materials that require allocation are:

e Production of concrete pipes and other precast
concrete products: All shared processes are
attributed to concrete products based on their mass.

e Steel scrap leaving the pipe manufacturing process:
the steel scrap generated at our sites has a negligible
contribution to our revenue and therefore has been
allocated with zero value.

e Fly ash: Economic allocation has been applied to fly
ash (value of $0), meaning that all environmental
impacts of the power plant have been allocated to
electricity as the main product. Fly ash has only
received the burdens of the transport to our sites.
Sensitivity analysis confirmed that this choice does
not have a significant effect on the GWP results.

e Steel slag: BFS is a by-product from steel-making.
We have used the AusLCI data for BFS (‘Blast Furnace
Slag allocation, at steel plant / AU U'}, which contain
impacts from pig iron production allocated to blast
furnace slag using economic allocation.

e Silica fume: silica-fume is a by-product of silicon
metal or ferrosilicon alloys production. Economic
allocation is used to attribute impacts between silica
fume and ferrosilicon production.

e Use of steel scrap in reinforcement steel: Recycling
allocation has followed the polluter pays principle in
line with EN 15804. See InfraBuild's EPD (S-P-00855)
of reinforcing rod and wire. Scrap entering ecoinvent
datasets does not carry any environmental impacts
either. Strictly speaking, this does not comply with
the latest scrap requirements in PCR 2019:14 v1.3.3,
but it is not possible to alter the underlying data in a
meaningful manner. The treatment of scrap entering
(in module A1) and leaving (in modules A3, C3) the
product system is consistent within this LCA.

rubber rings and mould oil is well below the
materiality cut-off and packaging materials
and quantities have therefore been estimated
only.

° The rubber ring lubricant applied to the socket
lead-in for skid joints is excluded from the LCA,
as the amount used is negligible.

e Capital goods (production equipment and
infrastructure) and personnel is excluded from
the LCA as these processes are non-
attributable, lack agreed definitions for
inclusion, and they contribute less than 10% to
GWP-GHG.

Key assumptions

e The concrete compositions at each site are
taken from Humes internal operating systems.

e For cement, we have used EPDs from our
cement suppliers where possible. Where data
gaps existed (including missing EN 15804+A1
results), these have been filled using AusLCI
data for general purpose cement. For missing
EN 15804+AT results, greenhouse gas
emissions are matched to our supplier's EPD
data as best as possible.

e For reinforcement steel, we have used
ecoinvent data, with GWP-GHG and ADP-fossil
indicators adjusted to align with our supplier's
published EN 15804+A1 compliant EPDs
where relevant.

e Allocation approaches may have a material
effect on concrete products containing fly ash,
ground granulated blast furnace slag and/or
silica fume.

° Additional environmental impact indicators
are not declared in the admixture EPDs, which
results in underreporting of these indicators.

Electricity

Electricity has been modelled for core processes
using adjusted AusLCI data to represent the
estimated residual electricity grid mix in Australia.
This is done by removing renewables from the
Australian Energy Statistics 2023 data (Table 01.1).
The GWP-GHG of the electricity is 0.91 kg CO2e /
KWh (aligned with NGA 2023). The proxy residual
grid mix is made up of black coal (53.9%), brown
coal (17.3%), natural gas (26.3%), and oil products
(2.5%). The contribution of electricity to cradle-to-
gate (A1-A3) GWP-GHG emissions is approximately
5-15%. Therefore, the choice for market-based or
location-based electricity accounting will have a
noticeable effect on the results

Declared unit

Reinforced concrete pipes are available in various
classes (wall thickness related), diameters, lengths and
joint types. After considering various options, it
became clear that there is no reasonable option that
allows different pipes to be grouped or averaged in a
meaningful way that is clear for the EPD user.
Therefore, we have opted to present the results (for
modules A1-A3, A4, A5, C1-C4, and D) for a
representative product for the production site, based
on the functional unit of:

e 1 tonne of reinforced concrete pipe (RCP),
including rubber rings, installed using the H1
bedding type.

For installation module AS results are best expressed
per metre of pipe length for a certain diameter, as
results per tonne of pipe are not easily interpreted. As
the use of multiple declared units are no longer
accepted in EPDs, the GWPs for various module A5
scenarios are included in the section “Additional
environmental information”. Even then, care should be
taken when comparing environmental impacts of
installation processes across EPDs.

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) results

An LCA serves as the foundation for this EPD. An LCA analyses the production systems of a product. It
provides comprehensive evaluations of all upstream and downstream energy inputs and outputs. The results

are provided in a form which covers à range of environmental impact categories.

Note regarding various GWP indicators.

GWP-total is calculated using the European Union's Joint Research Centre's URC) characterisation factors (CFs) based on the
‘EF 3.0 package” for CFs to be used in the EU's Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) framework. CFs listed by JRC include
indirect radiative forcing, which results in higher numerical Global Warming Potential (GWP) values than the CFs in the
internationally accepted (IPCC 2013).

The GWP-GHG indicator is identical to GWP-total except that the CFs for biogenic CO: are set to zero. The GWP-GHG
indicator in PCR 2019:14 v1.3 differs from the GWP-GHG in earlier PCR 2019:14 versions.

The GWP-GHG IPCC AR 5 indicator is determined using the IPCC ARS Global Warming Potentials (GWP) with a 100-year
time horizon. This indicator is aligned with Australia's greenhouse gas reporting frameworks.

1 The results of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these results are high or as there is limited
experienced with the indicator.

2 This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel cycle. It does not
consider effects due to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in underground facilities. Potential
ionizing radiation from the soil, from radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.

Please note: stage A1-A3 values reported in
this EPD incorporate the full production
process of the precast elements. This includes
concrete, steel, rubber rings, and precast
production processes including reinforcement
cage manufacture, casting, curing (steaming
and other curing methods), internal transport
checks and storage as well as routine
consumables used in the manufacturing
process. Therefore, these values should not
be directly compared to A1-A3 values per
tonne of concrete supplied by ready-mix, as
these values do not account for additional
embodied carbon in the precast production
process, steel reinforcement and rubber.

Variation (A1-A3) per impact category

The variations in the results for module A1-A3 is declared in the following table, based on the largest variation in GWP
between products manufactured at Blacktown and the representative product.

The variation is determined using the tables thereafter, which show the GWP values for each product manufactured
at this site as an example for how the environmental impacts vary by product type. The tables cover freshwater

Installation of pipes (module A5)

The installation of pipes cannot be expressed per tonne of pipe in a meaningful way, as there are too many
variables that would impact on the results. Instead, installation impacts are best described per length of pipe

of a particular diameter.

Installation —- Module A5

The installation of RCPSs in a storm-water system is
included in the LCA on the basis of a typical scenario.
The actual installation scenario can have a significant
impact on the environmental profile of module A5.

The type of support is selected depending on the
application (required performance) of the pipeline
system. The required strength of a concrete pipe
depends on both the load to be carried by the installed
pipe, and the supporting ground installation
conditions.

Installation processes include:

e  Excavation of the trench

e Placement and compaction of bedding materials
+ Placement of RCP

e  Filling of the trench and compaction.

Transport of imported and surplus materials is also
included as per the installation scenario. The values
of installation should be calculated per metre of
RCP of a particular diameter, regardless of the class
of pipe or whether the pipe is made using the spun
or dry-cast process. The environmental impacts
correlate strongly to the pipe diameter (ï.e. not to
the mass of pipes).

Bedding types for pipes are H1, H2, HS1, HS2, HS3,
and U. Where U denotes an Unsupported fill, H
denotes Haunch support, HS denotes Haunch and
Side support, and 1, 2, and 3 denotes the level of
support (compaction of fill) in the material used.
Further details are available in AS/NZS 3725: Design
for Installation of Buried Concrete Pipes.

Further information on trench dimensions for the
installation of RCP can be found in Humes’ Concrete
pipe reference manual (see www.humes.com.au).

The graph below shows how the GWP for module A5 (in kg CO2e for installation of one meter of pipe) varies

with pipe diameter and bedding type.

The default environmental profiles include end-of-life results for à scenario where pipes are abandoned and
left in-ground at end-of-life. Alternatively, concrete pipes may be exhumed and recycled. In this case, the pipes
are crushed to separate the concrete from the reinforcement steel, after which the concrete is assumed to
replace virgin aggregates and the steel can be recycled to replace steel produced through the virgin route.

The module C1-C4, D results for the recycling scenario pertaining to the representative product are provided
in the table below.
