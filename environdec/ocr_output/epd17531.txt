INTRODUCTION

Worldwide, there is a growing expectation for Governments and organizations to increase
transparency and disclosure regarding environmental impacts, particularly greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions. This trend has gained momentum since the landmark COP 21 Paris Agreement in 2015,
where nations collectively committed to ambitious efforts to combat climate change.

Simultaneously, the global demand for construction materials is on the rise due to population
growth and increased urbanization. Concrete, the world's second most utilized commodity after
water, significantly contributes to the embodied GHG emissions of infrastructure and property
assets. In light of Aotearoa's commitment to achieving net zero by 2050, Holcim New Zealand is
actively working towards a lower carbon footprint in the built environment.

For Holcim, building progress entails offering a comprehensive range of low carbon, high-
performance, and specialty concrete solutions tailored for Aotearoa's homes, buildings, and
infrastructure. We provide guidance, tools, and resources to empower you to confidently specify
your projects. Our commitment extends to delivering solutions that align with your needs
consistently.

This underscores the urgent need for construction materials both now and in the future,
emphasizing the construction materials industry's pivotal role in addressing climate change. At
Holcim, we acknowledge our responsibility to contribute to global emissions reduction targets.
To guide our efforts, we have developed a roadmap outlining specific actions to align with these
objectives.

Together, we can build better
to help decarbonise Aotearoa.

LCA INFORMATION

Declared Unit
The declared unit adopted is 1m$ of ready-mix concrete in
use.

Time Representativeness

The plant data for the LCA is based on 2022 calendar year
production data. The mix data for the LCA is based on 2024
calendar year production data.

Databases and LCA Software Used

The software used was SimaPro® LCA software (v 9.5.0.0).
The inventory data for the processes are entered in the LCA
software and linked to the pre-existing background data for
upstream feedstocks and services. Inventory data was
selected per the standards, in the following order of
preference:

e  Ecoinvent 3.9.1 database was used as the primary
source for inventory data (Ecoinvent v3.9.1, 2023).
At the time of this report, this Ecoinvent database
version is less than 1 year old.

° The Australian Life Cycle Inventory (AusLCI) v1.42
was compiled by the Australian Life Cycle
Assessment Society (ALCAS) - this data will comply
with the AusLCI Data Guidelines (Australian Life
Cycle Inventory Database Initiative (AUSLCI), 2023).
At the time of this report, this AusLCI database
version is less than 1 years old.

° The Environmental Footprint (EF) database v3.1 is
facilitated by the European Commission and
developed by ecoinvent, Sphera, Blonk, CEPE, and
Pré Sustainability (Developer Environmental
Footprint (EF), 2022). At the time of this report, this
EF database version is around 1 years old.

The following impact categories were calculated manually
for the foreground data:

e Use of renewable primary energy resources used as
raw materials (PERM)

e Use of non-renewable primary energy resources
used as raw materials (PENRM)

e Materials for recycling

e __Non-hazardous waste disposed

Data quality

Foreground data on raw material requirements,
manufacture and distribution was provided as primary
source by Holcim (NZ) for the year January 2022 -
December 2022. Schemes for data quality assessment of
generic and specific data from EN 15804+A2 are used to
perform this data quality assessment activity.

Upstream processes
The upstream processes include those involved in Module
A1 - raw material supply. This module includes:

. Extraction, transport, and manufacturing of raw
materials.

e Generation of electricity from primary and
secondary energy resources, also including their
extraction, refining and transport for Modules A1
and A3.

Generic data from LCA databases were used to model all
raw materials for ready-mix concrete, such as cement,
additives, admixtures, aggregates and sand, water, fly ash
and slag. The cellulose pulp is assumed to have 12.2 MJ/kg
as renewable energy resource used as raw material, based
on the energy density quoted for biomass municipal and
industrial materials in the National Greenhouse Accounts
Factors (Department of the Environment, 2021). À few
exceptions apply where suppliers of raw materials publish
product specific EPDs, which are incorporated in the
background processes to better reflect the environmental
impacts associated with these raw materials in processes
(e.g., extraction, transportation, manufacturing) before
arriving at Holcim (NZ) production plants.

Core processes

The core processes include those involved in Module A2
and Module A3 - upstream raw material transport and
manufacturing. They include:

e External transportation of materials to the core
processes and internal transport.

e Manufacturing of concrete.

e Transportation of materials for
landfilling externally

e Treatment of waste and wastewater generated
from the manufacturing processes.

recycling and

Al the materials used for producing ready-mix concretes
were transported via truck. Specifically, aggregates and
cements were assumed to be transported by heavy trucks
and other raw materials were assumed to be transported by
medium trucks.

Concrete manufacturing is undertaken at Holcim (NZ)
branded concrete batching plants. Al plants have the same
or similar site resource use profile, management systems
and operating systems. The process of manufacturing
concrete involves the careful proportioning and mixing of
cement, supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs),
aggregates, water, chemical admixtures and additives
including colour oxides in some instances. These raw
materials are mixed in batching plants according to the
specific concrete mix designs.

Site specific manufacturing data was collected during fiscal
year 2022. These include inputs like energy (e.g., electricity,
fuels, etc.) and outputs (e.g., waste to landfill, recyclables,
etc). They are allocated to 1m of ready-mix concrete
product based on the annual production volume in each
batching plant. Electricity is modelled based on the

ASHBY’S READY MIXED - 30MPA HS ECOPACT STRUCTURAL MIX EPD | 4
electricity grid mix from New Zealand Ministry of Business,
Innovation & Employment.

Electricity for the manufacturing site is modelled based on
the electricity mix published by the Ministry of Business,
Innovation and Employment, with primary source from
hydro (60%), geothermal (18%), wind (6.5%), gas (9.9%), and
coal (2.88%). The electricity emission (GWP-GHG) is 0.0742
kg COe/kWh.

Downstream processes
This includes deconstruction (Module C).

Deconstruction (C1) is assumed to use drilling to break and
remove the concrete. The distance for waste collecting from
construction site (C2) to landfill plant is assumed 50km. Al
products are assumed to be landfilled (C4) and there is no
carbonation at the end of life. It's assumed that there is no
recycling for the product at the end of life, so the C3 impact
is O.

No CO: uptake has taken place in any module declared.

Allocation

According to EN 15804+A2, in a process step where more
than one type of product is generated, it is necessary to
allocate the environmental stressors (inputs and outputs)
from the process to the different products (functional
outputs) in order to get product-based inventory data
instead of process-based data. An allocation problem also
occurs for multi-input processes. In an allocation
procedure, the sum of the allocated inputs and outputs to
the products shall be equal to the unallocated inputs and
outputs of the unit process.

The following stepwise allocation principles shall be
applied for multi-input/output allocations:

e __Theinitial allocation step includes dividing up the
system sub-processes and collecting the input and
output data related to these sub-processes.

° The first (preferably) allocation procedure step for
each sub-process is to partition the inputs and
outputs of the system into their different products
in a way that reflects the underlying physical
relationships between them.

e The second (worst case) allocation procedure step
is needed when physical relationship alone cannot
be established or used as the basis for allocation.
In this case, the remaining environmental inputs
and outputs from a sub-process must be allocated
between the products in a way that reflects other
relationships between them, such as the economic
value of the products.

Holcim (NZ) produces a range of concrete mixes at each of
their concrete batching plants, with the range dependent
on customer demand. Due to the random nature of which
mixes are produced and the large number of concrete
mixes, allocation was required to determine the amount of
site resource use, discharges and emissions associated with
each mix. Annual consumption of energy and resource were
collected at each site. Allocation was carried out based on
physical relationships - annual production amount, by
volume in m%. Its assumed that all kinds of ready-mix
concrete products consume the same amount of resource
and energy during production.

One exception is the fuel consumption for mixing and
loading in manufacturing plants. Holcim (NZ) performed a

fuel burn diagnostic report on a typical mixing truck they
owned. The fuel consumption for mixing and loading or
loading only (for some plants) for 1 m° product was
diagnosed, calculated, and directly used without any
allocation since it's measured per declared unit covered in
this EPD.

Cut-off Rules

It is common practice in LCA/LCI protocols to propose
exclusion limits for inputs and outputs that fall below a
threshold % of the total, but with the exception that where
the input/output has a “significant” impact it should be
included. According to the PCR 2019:14, life cycle inventory
data shall according to EN 15804+A2 include a minimum of
95% of total inflows (mass and energy) per module. It should
also include a minimum of 99% of renewable and non-
renewable primary energy use as well as the total mass
input of that unit process. Inflows not included in the LCA
shall be documented in the EPD. Data gaps in included
stages in the downstream modules shall be reported in the
EPD, including an evaluation of their significance. In
accordance with the PCR 2019:14, the following system
boundaries are applied to manufacturing equipment and
employees:

. Environmental impact from infrastructure,
construction, production equipment, and tools
that are not directly consumed in the production
process are not accounted for in the LCI. Capital
equipment and buildings typically account for less
than a few percent of nearly all LCIs and this is
usually smaller than the error in the inventory data
itself. For this project, it is assumed that capital
equipment makes a negligible contribution to the
impacts as per Frischknecht et al. with no further
investigation (Frischknecht, 2007).

e  Personnel-related impacts, such as transportation
to and from work, are also not accounted for in the
LCI. The impacts of employees are also excluded
from inventory impacts on the basis that if they
were not employed for this production or service
function, they would be employed for another. It is
very hard to decide what proportion of the impacts
from their whole lives should count towards their
employment. For this project, the impacts of
employees are excluded.

Based on this guidance, no energy or mass flows, except
packaging of materials were excluded. Al materials
required for manufacturing are delivered via trucks and
ships without packaging.

Comparability

EPDs within the same product category but registered in
different EPD programmes, or not compliant with EN
15804, may not be comparable. For further information
about comparability, see EN 15804 and ISO 14025.

Table 1. Assumptions, choices, and limitations

For simplicity and lacking comprehensive data, all
raw material packaging is excluded in this study.

The emission factors assigned to most raw
materials covered in this calculator are generic that
are available in the LCA databases. They are the
closest proxy based on the available raw material
information. If more specific impacts available from
suppliers in the future, they should replace the
current ones to better reflect the impacts of the raw
material.

Although transport distances are available for some
raw materials, others that don’t have the data are
estimated and assumed to be the average distance
of the corresponding material type.

This process EPD includes the GreenStar and IS
indicators for their future use in reporting on these
two platforms. However, the transport impacts in
Holcim’'s published EPD for its cement product
doesn't include these indicators. Thus, in the
background calculation of these indicators, the
tool uses the generic transport LCA background in
ecoinvent 3.9.1 (heavy truck) and made
assumptions that transport from Holcim terminal
Auckland to depot is 200km (truck transport only),
and transport from terminal Timaru to depot is
50km (truck transport only) Based on these
assumptions, the tool calculated the GreenStar and
IS indicators.

The amount of waste and wastewater produced are
estimated by Holcim (NZ). If more specific data is
available in the future, it could improve accuracy of
the impacts for 1m of product.

The deconstruction process is assumed to be the
same for all products.

Itis assumed 50km distance to landfill based on the
distance from likely construction sites within major
cities to main landfill sites for the area.

from radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this indicator.
