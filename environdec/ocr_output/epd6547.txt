Name and location of production site(s):

Since the products included in the EPD are new in the market, primary data related to product
composition has been gathered from first production tests in 2020. The results are valid for the
product produced in all the manufacturing plants of Holcim in Spain.

Product information

Product name: ECOPact Prime: H25, H30, H25 AGILIA, H30 AGILIA, ARTEVIA HDOS 330
and HYDROMEDIA.

Product description: Holcim is a leading manufacturer and supplier of high quality concrete and
mortar, and has projects and activities on road and network, collective housing.

Concrete and mortar production is a specific process: depending on the nature and quantity of
each of the components (cement, aggregates, water, additives), it will have different
characteristics. Once manufactured, the ready-mixed concrete/mortar is a fresh product, which
must be transported and used quickly on local markets, and under optimal conditions.

Holcim's concrete and mortar offer an outstanding combination of product quality and
performance. All products manufactured are high quality concrete and mortar, characterised
by their extraordinary capacity and great finishing. ECOPact Prime: H25, H30, H25 AGILIA,
H30 AGILIA, ARTEVIA HDOS 330 and HYDROMEDIA are concretes and mortars
manufactured at the Alcobendas, Valencia and Papiol plants in Spain.

The products are a ready-mixed concrete/mortar, and the ranges included are structural
concretes, except Artevia which is for use in continuous paving and Hydromedia which is a
draining concrete.

e For product references that have MPa: the use is structural.

e _Forthe product references that do not have MPa: the use is in paving and flooring (they donot have
the "strength" data, in MPa, because they are not structural and are not characterised by their
compression).

Reference service life: 100 years (as functional by the manufacturer) and recommended in c-
PCR for structural concrete.

Time representativeness: the data inventory of the LCA study presented is a new product
anddata for a complete year is not available yet. The residual electricity mix is from Spain in
2018. The amount used of raw materials (cement, water, gravel stone) has been obtained
from therecipe and first tests in Papiol, Valencia and Alcobendas manufacturing plant in
2020. Energyconsumption, waste production, pollutant emissions and transport distance
(in A2 and A4) have been obtained from Alcobendas, Valencia and Papiol manufacturing plants
in 2019 (from the first of January 2019 to the 31stof December 2019) since the production
process is the same for the different concrete products manufactured in the plants. The
composition of the specific cement used for each product has been obtained also directly
from the manufacturingplants and therefore corresponds to reality.

Database(s) and LCA software used: generic data on the impact per unit of matter or energy
have been taken to determine emissions per kg of matter, KWh of energy or tkm transported.

These data have been obtained from the Ecoinvent database version 3.8. (updated in <2
years) and Simapro 9.3. The impact models used are those indicated in UNE-EN
15804:2014+A2:2019.

Interpretation of results

As we can see in Table and Figure, the product stage (A1-A3) is the life cycle
stage with thegreatest impact for all the impact categories analyzed, representing
between 79,51% (Globalwarming and Resource use, minerals and metals) and
46,74% (Eutrophication, freshwater) ofthe total impact of the product life cycle.

The module (A4-A5) represents a low impact for all the impact categories analyzed.
Transport (A4) represents between 0,77% (Eutrophication, marine) and 2,52%
(Ozone depletion and Abiotic depletion fossils fuels) of the total life cycle impact.
On the other hand, A5-Installationstage represents 2% of the total impact for all
impact indicators.

In relation to End of life stages (C1-C4), the impact of C1 is between 34,54%
(Eutrophication, freshwater) and 1,52% (Photochemical ozone formation). C2
Transport represents between5,67% (Eutrophication, marine) and 21,19% for
Ozone depletion and Abiotic depletion fossilsfuels. Finally, C4 Waste treatment
represents an impact from 0,01% for Photochemical ozoneformation, and 2,32%
for Eutrophication, freshwater.

A'HOLCIM  FPD'

Holcim Spain has registered its carbon footprint in section a) of the Carbon
footprint and commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for the years
2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019.

The limits of the organization included in the calculation are: cement, concrete
and mortar manufacturing activity carried out in all its facilities in Spain, central
offices in Madrid and 63production centers

Our commitment to the circular economy as the main way to take advantage
of the waste life cycle

The transition from a linear economy to a circular economy is one of the
environmental priorities of our business. Within our activity, our objective is to
reuse the value of waste as resources, that is, to maximize its life cycle.

At Holcim, we achieve the transition to circularity by complementing the activity
of Geocycle, a subsidiary of the Group that is dedicated to the pre-treatment of
waste to turn itinto fuel, and the cement factories that use it in their clinker
production process (componentcement base).

Proactive restoration of our quarries

At Holcim we have been working, for more than 30 years, for the restoration of
our quarries with the aim of generating a net positive impact on biodiversity. We
are committed to a participatory model of quarry rehabilitation in which the
increase of biodiversity and naturalcapital is favoured.

Our restoration model serves as a lever for change on the critical problem of
biodiversity lossand its potential to reverse its current negative trend. This work,
key when it comes to creatingshared value with the communities in which we
operate, has been recognized in 2018 with thefirst second prize in the "Company
and Biodiversity" category in the latest edition of the European Business Awards
for the Environment , promoted by the Biodiversity Foundation.
