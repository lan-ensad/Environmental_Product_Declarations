Description of the organisation: Holcim is one of the world leaders in building materials and
solutions with activity in four business segments: cement, aggregate, concrete solutions and
products in the field of construction. Its ambition is to lead the industry towards reducing
carbon emissions and moving towards low carbon construction. With the strongest R&D area
in the industry, the company seeks to promote the development and marketing of high-quality
and sustainable building materials and solutions for its customers around the world.

Holcim has five cement factories in Spain with an installed capacity of seven million tons per
year, 20 concrete plants, a mortar plant, a plant for the preparation of alternative fuels from
waste, four terminals and two distribution centers, where about 700 employees work. The
company is distinguished by having the first Laboratory with an exclusive area of alternative
fuels and the first Research and Development Center for New Concrete and Mortars. Holcim
contributes to global development by making significant efforts in innovation, which
materialize in the creation of safe, sustainable and high-performance materials and solutions
that respond to customer challenges

Product-related or management system-related certifications:
Holcim has implemented ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 management systems.

Name and location of production site(s):

Since the products included in the EPD are new in the market, primary data related to product
composition has been gathered from first production tests in 2020. The results are valid for the
product produced in all the manufacturing plants of Holcim in Spain.

Product information

Product name: ECOPact Prime: AGILIA SUELO C and ARTEVIA HDOS 275.

Product description: Holcim is a leading manufacturer and supplier of high quality concrete
and mortar, and has projects and activities on road and network, collective housing. Concrete
and mortar production is a specific process: depending on the nature and quantity of

each of the components (cement, aggregates, water, additives), it will have different
characteristics. Once manufactured, the ready-mixed concrete/mortar is a fresh product, which
must be transported and used quickly on local markets, and under optimal conditions.

Holcim's concrete and mortar offer an outstanding combination of product quality and
performance. All manufactured products are high quality concrete and mortar, characterised
by their extraordinary capacity and great finishing. Products are a ready-mix concrete/mortar,
which is to be used in continuous pavements. Agilia Suelo C which is a self-leveling mortar.

LCA information
Functional unit: One m3 of ready-mix of concrete/mortar which fufills the requirements of

technical performance for construction for a reference service life of 100 years. Ready-mix
concrete for surface paving must be applied with a dosage of 260 to 275 kg/m*

Reference service life: 100 years (as functional by the manufacturer) and recommended in c-
PCR for structural concrete.

Time representativeness: the data inventory of the LCA study presented is a new product and
data for a complete year is not available yet. The residual electricity mix is from Spain in 20182.
The amount used of raw materials (cement, water, gravel stone) has been obtained from the
recipe and first tests in Papiol, Valencia and Alcobendas manufacturing plant in 2020. Energy
consumption, waste production, pollutant emissions and transport distance (in A2 and A4)
have been obtained from Alcobendas, Valencia and Papiol manufacturing plants in 2019 (from
the first of January 2019 to the 31° of December 2019) since the production process is the
same for the different concrete products manufactured in the plants. The composition of the
specific cement used for each product has been obtained also directly from the manufacturing
plants and therefore correspondés to reality.

Database(s) and LCA software used: generic data on the impact per unit of matter or energy
have been taken to determine emissions per kg of matter, KWh of energy or tkm transported.

These data have been obtained from the Ecoinvent database version 3.8. (updated in <2
years) and Simapro 9.3. The impact models used are those indicated in UNE-EN
15804:2014+A2:2019.

Interpretarion of results

As we can see in Table and Figure, the product stage (A1-A3) is the life cycle stage with the
greatest impact for all the impact categories analyzed, representing between 92%
(Eutrophication, freshwater) and 62% (Ozone depletion) of the total impact of the product life
cycle.

The module (A4-A5) represents a low impact for all the impact categories analyzed. Transport
(Ad) represents between 1,99% (Eutrophication, freshwater) and 4,77% (Ozone depletion) of
the total life cycle impact. On the other hand, A5-Installation stage represents 2% of the total
impact for all impact indicators.

In relation to End of life stages (C1-C4), the impact of C1 is between 23,51% (Resource use,
fossils) and 1% (Eutrophication, freshwater). C2 Transport represents between 4,62%
(Eutrophication, freshwater) and 23,51% for Resource use, minerals. Finally, C4 Waste
treatment represents an impact from 0,01% for Resource use, mineral and 1,63% for
Eutrophication, marine.

Additional information

With the aim of achieving a positive contribution to nature and society, we develop our activity
based on principles of sustainable development, through continuous improvement in our
environmental behaviour and focused on these four fundamental principles: our Management
System, control environmental impact, contribution to the circular economy and transparent
relationship with the environment.

CE

Holcim Spain has registered its carbon footprint in section a) of the Carbon footprint and
commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for the years 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and
2020.

The limits of the organization included in the calculation are: cement, concrete and mortar
manufacturing activity carried out in all its facilities in Spain, central offices in Madrid and 63
production centers

Our commitment to the circular economy as the main way to take advantage of the
waste life cycle

The transition from a linear economy to a circular economy is one of the environmental
priorities of our business. Within our activity, our objective is to reuse the value of waste as
resources, that is, to maximize its life cycle.

At Holcim, we achieve the transition to circularity by complementing the activity of Geocycle,
a subsidiary of the Group that is dedicated to the pre-treatment of waste to turn it into fuel,
and the cement factories that use it in their clinker production process (component cement
base).

Proactive restoration of our quarries

At Holcim we have been working, for more than 30 years, for the restoration of our quarries
with the aim of generating a net positive impact on biodiversity. We are committed to a
participatory model of quarry rehabilitation in which the increase of biodiversity and natural
capital is favoured.

Our restoration model serves as a lever for change on the critical problem of biodiversity loss
and its potential to reverse its current negative trend. This work, key when it comes to creating
shared value with the communities in which we operate, has been recognized in 2018 with the
first second prize in the "Company and Biodiversity" category in the latest edition of the
European Business Awards for the Environment , promoted by the Biodiversity Foundation.
