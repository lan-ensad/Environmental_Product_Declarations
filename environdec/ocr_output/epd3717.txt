ViroDecs'" EPD | Holcim 2
Introduction

All around the world, the expectation for Governments
and organisations to provide enhanced transparency
and disclosure of environmental impacts, such as
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, has been growing.
This follows the landmark COP 21 Paris Agreement in
2015 in which all nations agreed to ambitiously pursue
efforts to combat climate change andits effects.

Atthe same time, the global demand for construction
materials is also growing due to worldwide population
growth and an increase in urbanisation. In fact, concrete
is the second most used commodity in the world behind
water, and typically a major contributor to the embodied
GHG emissions of an infrastructure or property asset.

This clearly demonstrates both the essential need for
construction materials now and in the future, as well as
the necessity for the construction materials industry to
be a leading part of the solution addressing climate
change.

At Holcim, we recognise our responsibility to contribute
to global emissions reduction targets and we have
developed a roadmap with a number of actions to direct
our efforts.

Our ViroDecs " range of ready-mix concrete
represented by an Environmental Product Declaration
(EPD) is one suchinitiative for Holcim in Australia.

ViroDecs'" Special — a first for ready-mix

concrete in Australia

The Holcim ViroDecs!" Special provides project-specific,
on-demand Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) to
Holcim'’s customers. This capability represents a
significant step in Holcim's sustainability journey and
embodies our multi-disciplinary approach to embedding
sustainability into our organisation and operations. With
the introduction of our ViroDecs " Special, third-party
verified data will underpin our capability to work with our
customers from tender through to design and construction
to optimise ready-mix concrete mix designs and report on
sustainability performance.

The publication of the original ViroDecs " EPD in 2019
introduced quality, third-party verified embodied life cycle
impact data for ready-mix concrete into the Australian
market for the first time. Holcim has been pleased by the
positive response from the industry. The message was
loud and clear: “we want transparency and we want a
evidence-based approach to specification, procurement
and reporting”. With the introduction of our ViroDecs "
Special, Holcim's customers can specify concrete
sustainability performance in terms of CO--e, with the
confidence that our claims are backed by our third-party
verified EPD Process Certification.

Holcim ViroDecs'" Special is backed by an EPD
Process Certification. It's not only a first for concrete but
a first for any product in Australia. Our EPD Process
Certification is a stamp of approval to produce compliant
EPDSs in-house, opening up significant capability and
flexibility in producing and using life cycle impact data to
inform our operations and our customers.

To gain our EPD Process Certification, Holcim invested
in embedding Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) into our
systems and processes. We have satisfied a rigorous,
third-party evaluation in accordance with the relevant
ISO standards and guidelines of the International EPD
Programme and EPD Australasia.

This EPD has been developed using our EPD Process
Certification for the project North Queensland ECOPact
with production occurring at North Queensland.

Special-class concrete is typically
supplied to major and high-end
construction projects from high rise
buildings, dams and spillways, roads and
bridges to public works infrastructure etc.
Special-class concrete is typically
specified in accordance with the technical
parameters and performance
requirements, which can include high-
strength/high-performances concrete,
high durability or marine application, post-
tensioned, high-pumpability, super
workable, piling concrete, architectural
off-form finishes and other decorative
applications.

General Australian Standard AS 1379 sets
down a number of different ways of
specifying and ordering concrete to
promote uniformity, efficiency and economy
in production and delivery. It refers to two
classes of concrete: normal-class and
special-class.

LCA Information

Declared Unit

1 m° of ready-mix concrete.

Reference Service Life (RSL)

The RSL is not specified as the scope is from cradle to
gate.

Time Representativeness

The plant data for the LCA is based on 2017 calendar
year production data. The mix data for the LCA is based
on 2021 calendar year production data.

Databases and LCA Software Used

SimaPro (v8.4) was used for the LCA modelling which
developed the LCA Calculator, used as per the certified
EPD Process. It uses background data from:

1. The Australian National Life Cycle Inventory
Database (AusLCI) (2017)

2. Ecoinvent 3.4 (2017)

83. World Business Council for Sustainable
Development (WBCSD) Cement Sustainability
Initiative (CSI) Tool Project Database
(International Version) (2018); and

4. Product specific EPDs for admixtures and fibres.

The environmental impacts modelled from the CSI tool
and existing EPDs do not include impacts for the
additional Green Star (v1.2) impact categories included
in the environmental impact tables. The following impact
categories were calculated manually for the foreground
data:
e Use of renewable primary energy resources
used as raw materials
e Use of non-renewable primary energy excluding
non-renewable primary energy resources used
as raw materials
e Use of secondary material
e Use of renewable secondary fuels
e Use of non-renewable secondary fuels

Allocation

Allocation was necessary to proportion inputs and
outputs to intermediate flows at the quarry and
processes at the batching plant level.

As much as possible, intermediate flows were allocated
physically based on weight (quarries) or based on m 2 of
concrete (at the batching plant). At the quarry level,
whenever physical allocation was not possible,
economic allocation was carried out based on Holcim'’s
internal cost system.

Regarding inputs, it was assumed that fly ash and silica
fumes are waste products and therefore burden-free.
Ground granulated blast furnace slag from steel blast
furnace production was allocated economically. Please
refer to the “Recycled Material” section for further detail.

Holcim Ready-mix concrete is classified as Non-Dangerous Goods according to the Australian Code for the Transport
of Dangerous Goods by Road and Rail. The safety data sheet for pre-mixed concrete lists all associated hazard

phrases.

The gross weight of this declared material makes up a minimum of 99% of the products covered by this EPD.

Packaging

Holcim ready-mix concrete is delivered in bulk with no
packaging.

Recycled Material

BS EN 16757:2017 specifically lists the following
materials relevant to the study as co-products:

e Fly ash;
° Ground granulated blast furnace slag; and
°  Silica fume

As such, the above materials are considered as co-

products of their production process and the impacts for
their production process are allocated according to PCR

2012:01 Construction Products and Construction
Services (co-produced goods, multi-output allocation).

ViroDecs'" EPD | Holcim

Default background data from LCA databases was used

to model the above co-products:

° Fly ash: AusLCI process for fly ash treats it as a

waste material and only includes transport
impacts.
° Ground granulated blast furnace slag: the

AusLCI process for slag is allocated based on
economic value, as the product has a significant

economic value at the point of collection.

° _ Silica fume: the ecoinvent process for silica
fume treat it as a waste material and only
includes transport impacts.

The allocation approach of the AusLCI LCA database

was adopted as a default for secondary data and

The AusLCI dataset conforms to EN 15804 when
applying allocation to its various processes and sub-
processes.

While the LCA study and EPD only consider the cradle to gate environmental impacts of Holcim's ready-mix concrete,
practitioners using the EPD for the purpose of whole-of-life building studies or the functional comparison of different
building products on a whole-of-life basis will consider concrete’s other life cycle stages. Some of the environmental
impacts of benefits associated with other life cycle stages not included in this EPD are described in the following
sections.

Lifetime absorption of CO:

Carbonation is a natural process whereby concrete absorbs carbon dioxide (CO) from the atmosphere through a
chemical reaction between the CO; in the ambient air and hydration products within the concrete (CaOH:). Ready-mix
concrete can be subject to carbonation from the use stage onward (i.e. after construction and curing). From a life cycle
impact accounting perspective, this process can also be referred to as ‘reabsorption’, since the CO; emitted during the
cement manufacturing process can be paritly offset by the lifetime absorption of CO», therefore reducing the net CO;
emissions associated with concrete over its lifetime.

The carbonisation process is a commonly known process in building design and is typically taken into consideration by
engineers when specifying special-class concrete.

The total amount of CO; absorption during the life cycle of concrete is subject to a range of factors and varies over
time. The calculation has been standardised in the British and European Standard BS EN 16757:2017 Sustainability
of construction works — Environmental Product Declarations — Product Category Rules for concrete and concrete
elements. It is recommended that practitioners make use of this standard when conducting whole-of-life building
studies and if the building materials include substantial amounts of concrete. Please note that CO: absorption has not
been considered in this EPD andis not reflected in the EPD results tables.

End of life scenarios

BS EN 16757:2017 presents four end of life scenarios for concrete:

1. Disposal of concrete at a landfill site,

2. Reuse of recovered concrete elements in new construction works,

83. Use of concrete debris, e.g. In land restoration, or

4.  Crushing/recycling of concrete:
a. Crushed concrete substitutes primary material without further processing, or
b. Substitution of natural aggregates in fresh concrete.

Scenarios 2, 3 and 4 can all result in benefits and loads outside the system boundary and thus should be considered
in a whole-of-life building study or when comparing concrete products on a functional basis in line with BS EN
16757:2017.
