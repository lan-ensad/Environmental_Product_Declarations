Product information

Product name: ECOPact: H35 and H35 AGILIA

Product description: Holcim is a leading manufacturer and supplier of high quality concrete and
mortar, and has projects and activities on road and network, collective housing.

Concrete and mortar production is a specific process: depending on the nature and quantity of
each of the components (cement, aggregates, water, additives), it will have different
characteristics. Once manufactured, the ready-mixed concrete/mortar is a fresh product, which
must be transported and used quickly on local markets, and under optimal conditions.

Holcim's concrete and mortar offer an outstanding combination of product quality and

performance. AI manufactured products are high quality concrete and mortar, characterised
by their extraordinary capacity and great finishing.

LCA information

Functional unit: One m3 of ready-mix of concrete/mortar which fulfills the requirements of
technical performance for construction for a reference service life of 100 years. Ready-mix
concrete for structural applications has a strength of 35 MPa, while ready-mix concrete for
surface paving must be applied with a dosage of 450 kg/ms.

e For product references that have MPa: the intended use is structural.

e _Forthe product references that do not have MPa: the intended use is in paving and flooring
systems (those do not have the "strength" data, in MPa, because they are not structural and
are not characterised by their compression).

Reference service life: 100 years (as functional by the manufacturer) and recommended in c-
PCR for structural concrete.

Time representativeness: the data inventory of the LCA study presented representative of a
regular annual production inventory since Ecopact began to manufacturing on march 2021.
The residual electricity mix is from Spain in 2021 . The amount used of raw materials (cement,
water, gravel stone) has been obtained from the recipe in Papiol and Alcobendas
manufacturing plant in 2021. Energy consumption, waste production, pollutant emissions and
transport distance (in A2 and A4) have been obtained from Alcobendas and Papiol
manufacturing plants in 2021 (from the 1st of January 2021 to the 31st of December 2021)
since the production process is the same for the different concrete products manufactured in
the plants. The composition of the specific cement used for each product has been obtained
also directly from the manufacturing plants and therefore correspondés to reality.

Interpretarion of results

As we can see in Table 6 and Figure 4, the product stage (A1-A3) is the life cycle stage with
the greatest impact for all the impact categories analyzed, representing between 97,35%
(Eutrophication freshwater) and 73,79% (Ozone layer depletion) of the total impact of the
product life cycle.

The module (A4-A5) represents an intermediate impact for all the impact categories analyzed.
Transport (A4) represents between 0,02% (Eutrophication, freshwater) and 2,01% (Ozone

less than 2% of the total impact for all impact indicators.

In relation to End of life stages (C1-Cd4), the impact of C1 is between 15,89% (Eutrophication,
marine) and 0,44% (Eutrophication, freshwater). C2 Transport represents between 3,95%
(Eutrophication, marine) and 17,18% for Resource use, minerals and metals. Finally, C4
Waste treatment represents an impact from 0,01% for abiotic depletion mineral and 1,07% for
Eutrophication, marine.

Additional information

With the aim of achieving a positive contribution to nature and society, we develop our activity
based on principles of sustainable development, through continuous improvement in our
environmental behaviour and focused on these four fundamental principles: our Management
System, control environmental impact, contribution to the circular economy and transparent
relationship with the environment.

Holcim Spain has registered its carbon footprint in section a) of the Carbon footprint and
commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for the years 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and
2020.

The limits of the organization included in the calculation are: cement, concrete and mortar
manufacturing activity carried out in all its facilities in Spain, central offices in Madrid and 63
production centers

Our commitment to the circular economy as the main way to take advantage of the
waste life cycle

The transition from a linear economy to a circular economy is one of the environmental
priorities of our business. Within our activity, our objective is to reuse the value of waste as
resources, that is, to maximize its life cycle.

At Holcim, we achieve the transition to circularity by complementing the activity of Geocycle, a
subsidiary of the Group that is dedicated to the pre-treatment of waste to turn it into fuel, and
the cement factories that use it in their clinker production process (component cement base).

Proactive restoration of our quarries

At Holcim we have been working, for more than 30 years, for the restoration of our quarries
with the aim of generating a net positive impact on biodiversity. We are committed to a
participatory model of quarry rehabilitation in which the increase of biodiversity and natural
capital is favoured.

Our restoration model serves as a lever for change on the critical problem of biodiversity loss
and its potential to reverse its current negative trend. This work, key when it comes to creating
shared value with the communities in which we operate, has been recognized in 2018 with the
first second prize in the "Company and Biodiversity" category in the latest edition of the
European Business Awards for the Environment , promoted by the Biodiversity Foundation.

Information related to Sector EPD
Individual EPD.

Differences versus previous versions
The EPD was updated considering the following changes:

2"d version:

The registration number of the first version of the EPD is S-P-03786.

There is a new and specific EPD for ECOPlanet CEM I/A 42,5 N (S-P-05185),
therefore the values for the impacts in (A1 — raw materials) were updated.

The residual electricity mix used was from 2021 it means the impacts of electricity in
(A3-manufacture) were updated.

Transport consumptions for A4 have been updated according to specific consumptions
of the trucks used.

The grouping of concrete products is updated. On the first version of the EPD (S-P-
03786), up to 11 products were included, but on this version of the EPD products have
been separated in different EPDs.

The PCR 2019:14 version 1.11 is used.

3" version:

A new logotype of Holcim is used.
