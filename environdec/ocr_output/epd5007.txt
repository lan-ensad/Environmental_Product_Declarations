EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) was developed by Holcim (Costa Rica) S.A. under The
International EPD® System, according to European Standard CEN EN 15804 and PCR 2019:14 and C-
PCR-001 norms. The scope of this study is “Cradle to Gate” covering product stages using modules
A1-A3 from the Product Category Rules; for this declaration, modules C1-C4 and D were excluded,
since product fulfills the three conditions required by EN 15804:2012+A2:2019.

The declared unit used is one ton of cement (Holcim Fuerte). AI environmental performance
indicators have been declared for bulk and packaged cement. AIl primary data used in this study is
for the year 2020, at the Holcim cement plant located at Cartago, Costa Rica.

Holcim Fuerte cement delivers a low carbon footprint with the objective of enabling low-carbon
construction at scale, and contributing to the achievement of world-class environmental
certifications (e.g., LEED®), due to its lower clinker content.

These cements produced by Holcim (Costa Rica) are included within our corporate vision of
Sustainability. We invite you to learn more about our study, or to deep dive into any of the details

2. COMPANY INFORMATION

Owner of the EPD: Holcim (Costa Rica) SA

Contact: Catalina Mora, catalina.morar@holcim.com

2.1 Description of the organization

Holcim (Costa Rica) S.A. has been in the
country since 1964. It believes in building a
world that works for both people and the
planet. A world that allows people to live
safely, connected, and promotes common
welfare.

Through the application of high standards
(national and international) that guarantee a
safe work environment "Zero Harm, the care
of the environment helps develop policies for
an inclusive and diverse workplace. That is
why we are shaping the way we are moving
forward, on our journey to become a “Net
Zero” company.

—— EPD

On our way to becoming a “Net Zero”
company, we are:

e _Promoting sustainable construction

e The first global building materials
company to sign the United Nations
Global Compact (UNGC) "Business
Ambition for 1.5°C'initiative with goals

e Working on a 2030 action plan verified
by Science Based Targets initiatives
(SBTi).

As part of this ambition, Holcim Costa Rica is
working with a strong focus on sustainability;
we want to transform the way our Industry
works, and encourages the construction
sector to play a role in the most important
problems of our planet e.g. Climate Change,
Resources, Waste, etc. For this reason, our
vision of sustainability for the year 2030 goes
beyond the actions that a company must take
to reduce its impact, and focuses on four
areas:

1) Protect the climate by reducing our Green
House Gases (GHG) emissions.

2) Conserve water resources and
biodiversity.

3) Adopt a Circular Economy model and
optimization of resources.

4) Improve the quality of life of our
stakeholders and community.

The main actions that have allowed us to
reduce the environmental impact of our
activities and the footprint of the product
portfolio are:

e The use of alternative fuels to replace
the consumption of traditional fossil
fuels used for the cement production
process.
Ë:

olcim

e Automation of the operation to
guarantee the highest energy
efficiency of the process.

e Heat recoveryin the system toreduce
the thermal consumption of the
process.

e Use ofadded minerals (pozzolana and
limestone) to optimize the
composition of the cement and
improve its properties.

e Improve cement performance, and
increase its strength through the use
of grinding additives.

e  Comprehensive control of fuels and
raw materials used in the production
process to minimize the impact on
emissions.

e Use of continuous online monitoring
of emissions with state-of-the-art
equipment.

e  Preventive and Corrective
maintenance of equipment, such as
bag filters and electro filters to
reduce emissions of particulate
matter.

From the point of view of the construction
cycle, having products with a lower carbon
footprint, or with significant CO2 reductions
contributes in mitigating the environmental
impact generated by the sector and
encourages changes in the traditional way of
building.

Holcim Costa Rica, is committed to the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and
the national decarbonization strategy, and
has put its efforts into making Environmental
Product Declarations (EPD), which evaluate
the global warming potential (GWP), among
other environmental impacts, of materials of
construction, based on the amount of energy
required during the manufacturing process,

—— EPD

and the environmental impact of extracting or
producing raw materials, and the fuel used for
delivery of  finished products. These
documents comply with international ISO
standards and are recognized by certification
schemes for sustainable construction, such as
Leadership in Energy and Environmental
Design (LEED) v4.

The results presented in these EPDs will be
used as information for decision-making by
designers, developers, and builders, in the
phases of design, specification, and selection
of materials with a vision of environmental
responsibility, and promotion of sustainable
construction, with a focus in life cycle.

2.2  Product-related or management
system-related certifications

Holcim’'s Cartago cement plant has an
integrated management system certified
according to ISO 9001:2015 “Quality
Management”, and ISO 14001:2015
“Environmental Management Standards”.
Additionally, the organization's greenhouse
gas emissions inventory is verified according
to the requirements of the ISO 14064-1:2006
“Green House Gases” standard, and the
calculation of the Product Footprint for all
Cements is carried out in compliance with the
ISO 14067 “Green House Gases for Products”
standard verified by a third-party certification
body Instituto de Normas Tecnicas de Costa
Rica (INTECO).

3. PRODUCT INFORMATION

3.1 Product Name

Holcim Fuerte Cement. General purpose
Hydraulic Cement

3.2 Product identification
Type MM/C (CP)-28 (RTCR 479: 2015)
3.3 UN CPC Code

Holcim Fuerte cement is classified in the CPC
3744 category "Portland cement, aluminous
cement, slag cement and similar hydraulic
cements, except in the form of clinkers" under
the UN CPC v2.1 classification system.’

3.4 Product Description

Holcim Fuerte cement is recommended for
preparing general-purpose concretes, and
mortars that do not require high initial
strength. Its controlled Tricalcium Aluminate
(C3A) content of no more than 8%, provides a
moderate heat of hydration which favors the
reduction of surface cracking due to
shrinkage, when the curing parameters are
adequately controlled.

The inclusion of high-grade Holcim Limestone
gives it better attributes in terms of plasticity
in the fresh state of the mixtures, and reduces
the water requirement to reach the desired
workability parameters.

4. LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) INFORMATION

4.1  Declared Unit

1 ton of cement, bulk or bagged

4.2 Reference service life

As cement is integrated as the main
component of concrete and mortars, the
reference service life of cement-based
products is estimated to exceed 50 years, due
to their components and design
characteristics. Due to the potential for loss of
its properties, when  exposed to
environmental conditions of temperature and
humidity, the recommended shelf life for
cement is 45 days. It is recommended to
maintain cement in adequate storage
conditions, as indicated by the Portland
Cement Association (PCA), and American
Concrete Institute (ACI) [ACI chapter 2, and
Chapter 304 section 2.3].

4.3 Time representativeness

The production data correspond to the period
from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020.
Other reference data correspond to the latest
available version of Ecoinvent 3.6 Life Cycle
Database.

4.4  Database(s) and LCA software used

Ecoinvent Database 3.6. Life Cycle Analysis
model was developed using Global Cement
and Concrete Association (GCCA) Industry

EPD tool for cement and concrete (V3.0)
software.

4.5 Description of the system boundaries

The scope of the LCA study covers the
modules from Cradle to Gate (A1-A3), in
accordance with the requirements of the PCR
2019:14 "Construction Products", and the EN
15804:2012+A2:2019 standard. Cement
products meet the following characteristics:

e The material is physically integrated with
other products during its installation, in
such a way that these cannot be
physically separated at the end of their
useful life.

e The material is not identifiable at the end
of its useful life because of a physical and
chemical transformation process.

e The material does not contain biogenic
carbon.

The analysis of the system includes all phases
of the life cycle, from the extraction and
supply of raw materials, the consumption of
energy and materials, and the primary and
secondary manufacturing processes (their
inputs and outputs), to the finished and/or
packaged product at the end of the
manufacturing stage, as required by the
"Cradle to Gate" option of the Reference PCR.
The environmental impacts have been
evaluated considering all the phases ofthe life
cycle of the product in accordance with the
rules listed in the PCR 2019:14.

4.8.1 Assumptions

e Transportation of raw materials: The data
reported for the transportation of raw
materials and other supplies, are
estimates of distances traveled for supply
from the producer or distributor facilities.
Additionally, land and maritime transport
distances have been considered for
materials produced outside the national
territory. Travel and return distances
were considered for land transport by
road.

e Transportation of primary fuels: À generic
maritime transportation scenario is
assumed from the Gulf Coast in the US to
Costa Rica, according to the annual report
of the national fuel distributor (RECOPE).

e Carbon emissions: Based on the
methodology of the CO: and energy
Protocol of the Global Cement and
Concrete Association (GCCA) and through
stoichiometric calculations, the annual
calcination factor is determined in kg

is carried out based on the COe emission
factors determined by the GCCA protocol
and tool, in kg CO; / MI.

The electricity matrix was calculated with
data from the Costa Rica Energy Control
Center for year 2020, according to the
distribution presented in the table below.

Primary energy source %

2 Cutting rules

The data collected covers all raw
materials,  supplies and packaging
materials; associated transportation to
the manufacturing site; processes with
energy consumption and water use;
waste from the production phase and
emissions to air and water.

According to EN 15804 and the reference
PCR, flows can be omitted (cut off) from a
central process in the LCA up to a
maximum of 1% of the total mass of
material inputs or 1% of the total energy
content of fuels and energy.

3 Data quality

Al data was recorded daily, via
production lots records. Weekly, monthly
and annual reports were implemented as
part of the operational and financial
control. AÏl data was obtained directly
from the company for operational year
2020.

—— EPD

Consumption of raw materials, and
energy were recorded using automated
equipment and processes, mainly under
metrological control.

The calorific value data of the fuels used
were recorded by means of laboratory
analysis, in accordance with international
standards of American Society for Testing
and Materials (ASTM), and the use of
equipment under metrological control.

In general, the activity data was obtained
from complete records of annual
production; the data in such records was
derived using reliable equipment, typical
of a single production site, with a
temporal correlation between 1 and 10
years with respect to the sets of the
database, and with a local geographic
correlation vs representative sets of a
larger area, and with an equal or similar
technological correlation, with respect to
the database flows.

The company has an integrated
management system, developed
according to the standards INTE / ISO
9001:2015, INTE / ISO 14001:2015, INTE /
ISO 14064-1:2019 and INTE B5:2016,
certified by the Institute of Technical
Standards of Costa Rica. All certifications
ensure a process approach, together with
their measurement and monitoring,
through quality and environmental
performance indicators, audited
internally and externally on an annual
basis.

To ensure the conformity of the product,
the quality control laboratory is
accredited under the INTE/ISO
17025:2017 standard, and works
following the standard and technical
regulation of RTCR-479:2015.
Additionally, the carbon footprint of the

11
Ë:

olcim

products is determined and certified
under the INTE/ISO 14067:2019 standard.

4.8.4 Allocation rules

Whenever possible, allocation was
avoided. The production was divided into
two main processes, Clinker and Cement,
and the input and output data related to
each one was collected. In some cases,
the data could not be directly attributed
to the production of the specific product,
so they were assigned by physical
properties (i.e., mass).

All raw material consumption is based on
a specific product formulation, and data is
recorded for each product under the
company's quality control system,
including all inputs for the production
process (e.g. additives).

The allocation of electrical energy
consumption for each cement product
was calculated from the internal records
measured by independent process
meters, for the manufacturing of each
product.

For common consumptions, such as
water consumption, as well as common
production outputs, such as furnace
emissions and solid waste generation, a
total allocation was made based on the

4.8.5

— EPD

total annual production of clinker, this
being the main raw material of cement.

The allocation of the packaging paper was
made by subtracting the weight of the
products sold in bulk, since only the
product in bags needs packaging.

Impact assessment methods

The characterization methods meet the
specifications of the EN
15804:2012+A2:2019 standard, including
IPCC (EF), WMO, ReCiPe, CML, AWARE,

SETAC-UNEP, USEtox, LANCA, among
others.
4.8.6 Information excluded

4.8.7  ACV developer:

The environmental impact of
infrastructure, construction, production
equipment and tools that are not directly
consumed in the production process are
not accounted for in the LCA.

Impacts related to personnel, such as

transportation to and from work, are also
not accounted for in the LCA.

8. RESULTS ANALYSIS

Environmental declarations for products
within the same product category from
different programs may not be comparable.
Likewise, the results of this Environmental
Declaration for construction products may
not be comparable with other EPDs, if they do
not comply with the EN 15804:2012+A2: 2019
standard.

The following interpretation of the results is
representative of the average for one ton of
Holcim Fuerte cement.

In general, the environmental impact
potentials, and their indicators are dominated
by the Clinker manufacturing stage (main
cement raw material) followed by the
extraction and transportation of raw

—— EPD

materials, also including fuels for the
manufacturing stage.

The results obtained by Holcim Costa Rica for
each of the impact categories and their
associated indicators for the production of
Holcim Fuerte cement (bagged) are presented
below.

The graphs for the bulk presentation are not
shown due to the similarity of the
distributions of the impact categories with
those of bagged presentation.

Whenever it is appropriate, the impact of the
packaging materials corresponding to the
bagged presentation will be addressed in the
following discussion.

Carbon dioxide and methane emissions
from the use of energy resources,
electricity and fuels, are the main source
of contribution in the  clinker
manufacturing process to the Global
Warming Potential (GWP) indicators, with
the GWP-fossil indicator representing the
most important with respect to the total
registered  (>99%). Through the
optimization of the Clinker factor in the
cement formulation the impact potential
is reduced.

The Acidification Potential (AP), Ozone
Depletion Potential (ODP) and
Eutrophication Potential (EP) indicators
are mainly associated with emissions into
the atmosphere from the clinker
manufacturing process,  specifically
emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulfur
oxides and volatile organic compounds
being the most significant contribution.
The cement plant has technology in its
clinker kiln, and in the pre-calcining tower
that allows it to operate with high
environmental standards, thus reducing
its NO, and SO; emissions. This condition,
with the company's efforts to analyze and
control the composition of its raw
materials and fuels, continuously control
atmospheric emissions. The reduction of
consumption of traditional fossil fuels by
substitution with alternative fuels, are
reflected in the  aforementioned
indicators.

—— EPD

The influence of transport in the
manufacture of clinker is mainly caused
by the transport of domestic raw
materials and the transport of imported
fuels, with the ODP, EP, Abiotic Depletion
Potential for non-fossil resources (ADPE)
and Abiotic Depletion for fossil resource
Potential (ADPF) indicators being those
where the contribution exceeds 20% of
the magnitude of the results. In the case
of cement production, the impact from
the transport of raw materials and fuels is
of less significance, not exceeding 10% of
the results obtained for each indicator. To
a lesser extent, the contribution of the
extraction phase of raw materials in the
manufacture of Clinker of <10% is
identified.

The results from the ADPF indicator show
that the production processes are
characterized by the lower demand for
fossil resources, due to the national
electricity matrix, primarily based on
renewable sources, as well as the high
substitution of traditional fossil fuels for
alternative ones.

The Water Deprivation Potential (WDP)
indicator shows a lower impact regarding
water consumption. This is because ofthe
local conditions of high availability of
water resources, and the efficient use of
water through a closed recirculation
system in the manufacturing operation.

The results of the resource use indicators
of the Fuerte cement production process
show that the greatest source of impacts
is the supply and manufacture of raw
materials (clinker), which represents the
main consumption of renewable primary
energy resources (national electricity
matrix) of >70% of Total Use of
Renewable Primary Energy Resource
(PERT), as well as the main consumption
of  non-renewable primary energy
resources (fossil fuels) of > 90% of Non-
Renewable Primary Energy Resource
(PERNT).

The results from the Use of Renewable
Primary Energy excluding Primary Energy
Resources used as raw material (PERE)
indicator come from the use electricity
from the of highly renewable national
energy matrix, in contrast with other
countries from the region.

For the cement results, the indicator of
Use of renewable Primary Energy
resources used as Raw Materials (PERM),
is determined by the materials for
packaging and dispatch that include wood

on pallets and paper in packaging bags.

The use of alternative fossil fuels from
pre-classified municipal and industrial
solid waste, one of the company's key
impact mitigation strategies, determines
the contribution to the Non-Renewable
Secondary Fuel Use Indicator (NRSF). The
result of this strategy stands out in the
reduction of the PERNT indicator in
exchange for a wide increase of the NRSF.

The Secondary Materials (SM) indicator is
defined by the recovery and use of iron
oxide waste (industrial origin) and glass
waste  (post-consumer origin and
industry), which contributes to reducing
the demand for primary renewable
resources in the clinker manufacturing
and is proportionally reflected in the
cement result.

The use of fresh water, Net Use of Fresh
Water (NFW), originates mainly from the
direct consumption of the operation,
which has a recirculation process to
supply the multiple cooling systems, and
thus, significantly reduce the local impact.

9. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

9.1 Origin of Raw Materials

The supply of the main raw materials for the
production of cement is carried out through
the extraction of materials in our quarries.
The limestoneis extracted in Agua Caliente de
Cartago, Costa Rica where our cement
production plant is located, while the
Pozzolana is extracted in Llano Grande de
Cartago, Costa Rica, and the high-grade
limestone in Azul de Turrialba, Costa Rica, at
17 km and 45 km from our production plant,
respectively, which contributes to the
reduction of the environmental impacts
related to the transportation of raw materials.
The material extracted from these sites
represents 94% of the raw materials
consumed. This feature contributes to the
calculation of the credit value Materials and
Resources category of the LEED v4 and v4.1.

9.2 Air Emissions - VOC

The Low-Emitting Materials Credit” in LEED v4
and v4.1 recognizes that plain concrete is an
inherently non-emitting material, and no
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) emission
testing is required. Therefore, since cement is
the basic component of concrete, it is also
considered an inherentlÿy non-emitting
source. To maintain this condition, without
any testing for VOC emissions, it must be
ensured that the concrete application does
not include integral organic based surface
coatings, binders or sealers.
