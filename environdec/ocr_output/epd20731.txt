Holcim - Ready-Mix Concrete - EPD
INTRODUCTION

Currently, the building environment account for 39% of
global CO2 emissions, with construction materials
comprising 11% of global CO2 emissions (World Green
Building Council). By 2030, the embodied carbon of all
construction materials needs to be at least 40% lower.
By 2050, all new construction materials need to be net
zero (World Green Building Council).

Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) play a
crucial role in promoting transparency and sustainability
in the construction industry. By providing comprehensive
and standardised information about the environmental
performance of products, EPDs enable informed
decision-making among stakeholders, including
architects, engineers, builders, and consumers.

ABOUT HOLCIM

Holcim Australia is a leading supplier of construction
materials in Australia, dating back to 1901. Today
Holcim continues to supply essential construction
materials including aggregates, sand, ready-mix
concrete, engineered precast concrete and prestressed
concrete solutions to a range of customers and projects
throughout Australia.

Holcim operates right across the Australian continent
supplying concrete from a network of concrete plants,
quarries, precast and concrete pipe places, and mobile
and on-site project facilities.

EPDs include data on a products life cycle impacts,
such as its carbon footprint, energy consumption, and
resource use. This transparency empowers
stakeholders to make informed selections of products.

EPDSs also serve as valuable tools for benchmarking
environmental performance and driving the
decarbonation of construction materials. Demand for
low carbon products backed by an EPD drives and
rewards the decarbonisation of the entire supply chain.

As a result, EPDs will play a key role in our mission to
decarbonise construction materials and the built
environment.

Sustainability is at the core of our strategy, with our
industry's first 2050 net-zero targets, endorsed by the
Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).

Globally, Holcim is 63,000 people around the world who
are passionate about building progress for people and
the planet through four business segments: Cement,
Ready-Mix Concrete, Aggregates and Solutions &
Products.

À FIRST FOR READY-MIX CONCRETE

IN AUSTRALIA

In 2019, Holcim published the first EPD for ready-mix
concrete. This was an Australian first for ready-mix
concrete and covered Holcim's Normal-class concrete
range across Australia. The EPD had 147 datasets for
normal-class concrete that representative of over 4,000
mix designs. The EPD also provided Special-class
concrete data for a major Infrastructure Sustainability and
Green Star building project. This EPD heralded the
introduction of rigorously verified life cycle impact data,
setting a new benchmark in transparency and
accountability within the Australian construction sector.

Fast forward to 2021, Holcim achieved Process EPD
Certification, a first not just within the concrete industry but
across all sectors in Australia. This certification empowers
Holcim to develop and register EPDs on demand for
ready-mix concrete.

Holcim - Ready-Mix Concrete - EPD

To achieve EPD Process Certification, Holcim integrated
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) processes and procedures
into its Management Systems. We then undergo ongoing
rigorous third-party verification in accordance with

internationally recognized ISO standards and guidelines.

This EPD has been developed using our EPD Process
Certification with production occurring at the following
sites.

Summary of properties and classes

Concrete is prepared by mixing cement, coarse and fine
aggregates, and water, with or without the addition of
auxiliary agents and additives. The fresh concrete is placed
on the building site or prefabricated in factory moulds,
compacted and hardened in the desired shape by the
hydration of cement to form concrete.

General Australian Standard AS 1379 sets out ways of
specifying and ordering concrete to promote uniformity,
efficiency and economy in production and delivery. It refers
to two classes of concrete: normal-class and special-class.

° Normal-class -— designed for everyday applications
such as residential and commercial foundations,
driveways and footpaths.

+ Special-class — typically supplied to major
construction projects from high rise buildings, dams
and spillways, roads, bridges to public works
infrastructure etc.

Special-class concrete is typically specified in
accordance with the technical parameters and
performance requirements, which can include high-
strength/high-performances concrete, high durability,
or marine application, post-tensioned, high-
pumpability, super workable, piling concrete,
architectural off-form finishes and other decorative
applications.
LCA INFORMATION

Declared Unit

1 m$ of ready-mix concrete.

Scope
The scope of this EPD is cradle to gate (modules A1-A3)

with options, modules A4-A5, modules C1-C4 and
module D.

Reference Service Life (RSL)

The RSL is not specified as the scope of Holcim's
operational control is from cradle to delivery.

Time Representativeness

The plant data for the LCA is based on 2022 calendar
year production data. The mix data for the LCA is based
on 2023 calendar year production data.

Databases and LCA Software Used

SimaPro® LCA software (v 9.5) was used for the LCA
modelling which developed the LCA Calculator, used as
per the certified EPD Process. It uses background data
with the following preferences:
1. Product specific EPDs for cements, admixtures,
pigments and fibres
2. The Australian National Life Cycle Inventory
Database (AusLCI v1.42) (2023)
3. Ecoinvent 3.9.1 (2023).
The environmental impacts modelled from the existing
EPDs do not include impacts for EN15804+A1, and the
additional Green Star (v1.3) impact categories included
in the environmental impact tables. These indicators are
modelled separately based on generic processes. The
following impact categories were calculated manually for
the foreground data:
° Use of renewable primary energy resources
used as raw materials
° Use of non-renewable primary energy excluding
non-renewable primary energy resources used
as raw materials
° Use of secondary material
° Use of renewable secondary fuels
° Use of non-renewable secondary fuels

Holcim - Ready-Mix Concrete - EPD

Allocation

Allocation was necessary to proportion inputs and
outputs to intermediate flows at the quarry and
processes at the batching plant level.

As much as possible, intermediate flows were allocated
physically based on weight (quarries) or based on m° of
concrete (at the batching plant). At the quarry level,
whenever physical allocation was not possible,
economic allocation was carried out based on Holcim's
internal cost system.

Regarding inputs, it was assumed that fly ash and silica
fumes are waste products and therefore burden-free.
Ground granulated blast furnace slag from steel blast
furnace production was allocated economically. Please
refer to the “Recycled Material” section for further detail.

Cut-Off Criteria

In accordance with the PCR 2019:14, the following
system boundaries are applied to manufacturing
equipment and employees:

° __ Environmental impact from infrastructure,
construction, production equipment, and tools
that are not directly consumed in the production
process are not accounted for in the LCI. Capital
equipment and buildings typically account for
less than a few percent of nearly all LCIS and
this is usually smaller than the error in the
inventory data itself. For this project, it is
assumed that capital equipment makes a
negjligible contribution to the impacts as per
Frischknecht et al. (2007) with no further
investigation.

e  Personnel-related impacts, such as
transportation to and from work, are also not
accounted for in the LCI. The impacts of
employees are also excluded from inventory
impacts on the basis that if they were not
employed for this production or service function,
they would be employed for another. It is very
hard to decide what proportion of the impacts
from their whole lives should count towards their
employment. For this project, the impacts of
employees are excluded.

Based on this guidance, no energy or mass flows,
except packaging of materials were excluded. All
materials required for manufacturing are delivered via
trucks and ships without packaging.

of Dangerous Goods by Road and Rail. The safety data sheet for pre-mixed concrete lists all associated hazard
phrases. None of the products contain one or more substances that are listed in the “Candidate List of Substances of
Very High Concern for authorisation”. According to the PCR 2019:14, if one or more substances of the “Candidate List
of Substances of Very High Concern (SVHO) for authorisation” are present in a product and their total content
exceeds 0.1% of the weight of the product, they need to be reported.

Holcim - Ready-Mix Concrete - EPD 10
Packaging

Holcim ready-mix concrete is delivered in bulk with no packaging.

Recycled Material

BS EN 16757:2017 specifically lists the following materials relevant to the study as co-products:
° _ Flyash,
° Ground granulated blast furnace slag; and
e  Silica fume.

As such, the above materials are considered as co-products of their production process and the impacts for their
production process are allocated according to PCR 2019:14 Construction Products and Construction Services (co-
produced goods, multi-output allocation).

Default background data from LCA databases was used to model the above co-products:

° Fly ash: AusLCI process for fly ash treats it as a waste material and only includes transport impacts.

° Ground granulated blast furnace slag: the AusLCI process for slag is allocated based on economic value, as
the product has a significant economic value at the point of collection.

e  Silica fume: the ecoinvent process for silica fume treat it as a waste material and only includes transport
impacts.

The allocation approach of the AusLCI LCA database was adopted as a default for secondary data and processes
(e.g. secondary fuel in cement production). The AusLCI dataset conforms to EN 15804 when applying allocation to its
various processes and sub-processes.

Cradle to Gate (Modules A1 - A3)

Raw materials for producing Holcim’s ready-mix concrete include cementitious materials, aggregates, admixtures,
oxides, fibres, water, and ice. These raw materials are generally transported from various locations around Australia,
China, Indonesia, and Europe. The raw materials are stored in silos, hoppers, ground bins or tanks. The materials are
feed to batching plant hopper with calibrated scale. Then all the raw materials are discharged via a chute into the
ready-mix concrete truck. Water is then weighed, or volume metered and discharged into the mixer truck through the
same charging tank.

Holcim's ready-mix concrete is manufactured across ACT, NSW, QLD, SA, VIC, and WA, Australia. State-specific
electricity mix available in the AusLCI database is used to model electricity in the foreground processes. The AusLCI
dataset was last updated in 2023.

Gate to Site (Module A4)
Distribution is dependent on the market requirements of ready-mix concrete products. All Holcim ready-mix concrete

products transported in Australia is by EUROS 28t — 32t trucks. The transport distances from manufacturing gate to
the site is 11.89 km. The product weight for 1m* ready-mix concrete is the sum of weights from all raw material inputs.

Installation (Module A5)

As Holcim does not have operational control over the installation of ready-mix concrete at the construction site,
assumptions for construction inputs and installation waste are made based on industrial expertise and experience,
and the GCCA tool. The inputs account for the pouring of concrete from a ready-mix truck and pump, excluding any
pre-installation activities such as site work and forms. The concrete slabs are then manually finished, and no
additional inputs are required to be modelled.

Deconstruction and End of Life (Modules C1 - C4)

EN 15804 (chapter 7.2.3.3) and applicable PCRS discourage the use of the results of modules A1-A3 & (AL-A5 for
services) without considering the results of module C.

Following the supply of ready-mix concrete products, Holcim has no control over the end-of-life fate for their products.
The recommended cradle to gate environmental profile will be based on the most common scenario as the majority of
construction products are generally deconstructed and transported for recycling. The following assumptions have
been used in this study to model deconstruction and end of life scenarios of Holcim's ready-mix concrete:
+ _ Deconstruction is modelled as the physical process of drilling and removing the concrete. Hydraulic excavator
is assumed as the operating tool for deconstruction. This process is based on ecoinvent v3.9.1 (2023)
database and the diesel used is extracted from the process.
° 100% of the products (2,400 kg) are assumed to be separately collected during deconstruction.
+ 25 km delivery distance to landfilling as well as reprocessing facility is assumed for waste collection process
since there was no primary data available.
° _Assume 80% of the product is reprocess / recycled as Module C3. This is based on the 2022 National Waste
Report (DCCEEW, 2023).
° The remaining waste concrete undergoes inert waste landfill as Module C4.

C1 — Deconstruction Diesel 1.31E-01

C2 — Transportation Distance to processing 2.50E+01 km
C3 — Waste processing Concrete recycling 1.92E+03 Kg

C4 — Final disposal Inert waste landfill 4.80E+02 kg

Benefits and loads beyond the system boundary (Module D)
The recycling and recovery rate of waste concrete is 80% based on the National Waste Report rate (DCCEEW, 2023).

The end-of-life recyclers process the waste concrete into a recycled aggregate, which can be replaced with virgin
coarse aggregate for a range of applications depending on the products performance requirements.

*Disclaimer — The results of these environmental impact indicators shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these results are high or as
there is limited experience with the indicator.

*Disclaimer — This impact category deals mainly with the eventual impact of low dose ionizing radiation on human health of the nuclear fuel
cycle. It does not consider effects due to possible nuclear accidents, occupational exposure nor due to radioactive waste disposal in
underground facilities. Potential ionizing radiation from the soil, from radon and from some construction materials is also not measured by this
indicator.

*#* _ GWP-GHG (IPCC ARS) is an additional GWP100 indicator that is aligned with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
2013 Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) (IPCC 2013), national greenhouse gas reporting frameworks in Australia and New Zealand and previous
versions of the Construction Products PCR (PCR2019:14v1.11). It excludes biogenic carbon and indirect radiative forcing.

OTHER LIFE CYCLE STAGES NOT
INCLUDED IN THIS EPD

While the LCA study and EPD only consider the cradle to gate (modules A1-A3) with options modules A4-A5, modules
C1-C4 and module D of the environmental impacts of Holcim's ready-mix concrete, practitioners using the EPD for the
purpose of whole-of-life building studies or the functional comparison of different building products on a whole-of-life
basis will consider concrete’s other life cycle stages. Some of the environmental impacts of benefits associated with
other life cycle stages not included in this EPD are described in the following sections.

Lifetime absorption of CO:

Carbonation is a natural process whereby concrete absorbs carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere through a
chemical reaction between the CO: in the ambient air and hydration products within the concrete (CaOH). Ready-mix
concrete can be subject to carbonation from the use stage onward (i.e. after construction and curing). From a life cycle
impact accounting perspective, this process can also be referred to as ‘reabsorption’, since the CO: emitted during the
cement manufacturing process can be partly offset by the lifetime absorption of CO, therefore reducing the net CO:
emissions associated with concrete over its lifetime.

The carbonisation process is a commonly known process in building design and is typically taken into consideration by
engineers when specifying special-class concrete.

The total amount of CO: absorption during the life cycle of concrete is subject to a range of factors and varies over
time. The calculation has been standardised in the British and European Standard BS EN 16757:2017 Sustainability
of construction works — Environmental Product Declarations — Product Category Rules for concrete and concrete
elements. It is recommended that practitioners make use of this standard when conducting whole-of-life building
studies and if the building materials include substantial amounts of concrete. Please note that CO: absorption has not
been considered in this EPD and is not reflected in the EPD results tables.
