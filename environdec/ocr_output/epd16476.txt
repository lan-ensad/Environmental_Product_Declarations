LCA INFORMATION

Declared Unit

This EPD represents the environmental impacts of one ton (1 000 kg) of ECOPlanet CEM V/A (Q-S)
42.5 N manufactured by Holcim España in Sagunto, marketed in bulk, ready to send to customers.

A reference service life is not relevant due to this cradle-to-gate boundary conditions.

System boundaries

This EPD covers all product stages from “cradle to gate” (modules A1-A3), since the product fulfils
all the conditions required by EN 15804:2012+A2:2019/AC:2021 regarding the exclusion of
modules B1 to D:

1. The product is physically integrated with other products during installation so they
cannot be physically separated at the end of life.

2. The product is no longer identified at the end of life as a result of a physical-
chemical transformation process.

8. The product does not contain biogenic carbon.

This means that all processes up to the output gate of
the manufacturer are included, from quarry works and
components manufacturing, to transports of materials
and fuels, factory process and final preparation. All direct
and indirect environmental impacts have been
calculated and are reported in this document.

Holcim España has a complete control over all the
processes within the factory and the quarry of main raw
materials.

The LCI includes, in accordance with EN 15804, a minimum of 95% of the total input flows (mass
and energy) per module (e.g. A1-A3). In addition, the PCR applies the expanded cut-off rule of the
ISO 21930 standard, which establishes at least 95% of the environmental impact per module.

The only processes that are not controlled directly by the company are the production of main
fuels, electricity, some additions, the transport of the raw materials, and minor inputs excluded
according to the cut-off rules.

According to the PCR, the following elements or processes have also been excluded:

e Manufacture of the equipment used in the production, buildings, or any other capital
goods.

° Transport of people to the manufacturing plants.

e Transport of people inside the manufacturing plants.

e  R+D activities.

e _Long-term emissions.

To model the impacts of the electricity used in the plant, the mix of the electricity company, using
100% of renewable sources, has been used. This electricity mix has a Climate Change impact of
0.079 kg CO2e/kWh (GWP100-GHG).

A simplified model of the process of cement manufacturing is described in the following diagrams,

Technical Information

Calculation Methodology

This EPD represents Typelll Environmental Declarations according to ISO 14025:2006. The inherent
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been developed according to ISO 14040 and ISO 14044
International Standards, and following the International EPD System General Programme
Instruction (GPI 4), the PCR 2019:14 Construction products (EN 15804:A2); Version 1.3.4; 2024-04-
80 and c-PCR-001 Cement and Building Lime (EN 16908:2019) 2024-04-30.

Version 3.17 of software Air.e LCATM with EcoinventT" 3.10 (system model Allocation, cut-off,
EN15804) database has been used for LCA modelling and impacts calculations.

The following impacts and units have been used, calculated according to the models in EF 3.1:

Global Warming Potential (GWP Total) kg of CO2 equivalent
Global Warming Potential (GWP Fossil) kg of CO equivalent
Global Warming Potential (GWP Biogenic) kg of CO equivalent
Global Warming Potential (GWP LULUC) kg of CO2 equivalent
Ozone depletion kg of CFC11 equivalent
Acidification mol of H+ equivalent
Eutrophication fresh water kg of P equivalent
Eutrophication marine water kg of N equivalent
Eutrophication terrestrial mol of N equivalent
Photochemical ozone creation kg of NMVOC equivalent
Depletion of abiotic resources (elements)* kg of Sb equivalent
Depletion of abiotic resources (fossil fuels)* MI net calorific value
Water scarcity* m* world equivalent

* The result of this environmental impact indicator shall be used with care as the uncertainties on these results are high or
as there is limited experience with the indicator.

10 Environmental Product Declaration of CEM V/A (Q-S) 42.5 N - Sagunto
( HOLCIM = F PD°

THE INTERNATIONAL EPD° SYSTEM

All processes related to the product have been included in the assessment.

According to EN 15804:2012+A2:2019/AC:2021 and EN 16908:2017, some components with less
than 1% impact or use of co-products with no significant economic value have been excluded from
the assessment.

AL transportation and components have been included in this LCA, considering real loads and
distances traveled by the materials used between January 2023 and December 2023. The main
means of transportation have been included for the purchase of fuel and external raw materials.
Operations in the port have been excluded.

The distances by road and sea have been mainly provided by each factory according to their own
records.

Assignments have been avoided where possible. Allocation was only used for verified direct
emissions of the furnace, where the clinker produced can subsequently be used to produce
different cements.

Cut-off rules: more than 95% of the total input flows (mass and energy) per module (e.g. A1-A3)
have been included. In addition, the PCR applies the expanded cut-off rule of the ISO 21930
standard, which establishes at least 95% of the environmental impact per module.

The recycled components are considered from the selection and processing plant of the recovered
materials.

The Polluter Payer Principle and the Modularity Principle had been followed.

Emission Factors and Tools

The emission factors and environmental impacts of the elements in the life cycles that are not
controlled by Holcim España, or direct emissions that has not measured or calculated, come from
Ecoinvent database, version 3.10, using the cut-off EN 15804 criteria of that database.

The LCA has been developed using the software Air.e LCA v3.17.

Data quality

According to the environmental footprint product category rules quality data criteria, and
considering that the data used for the processes is representative of the geography scope declared,
that there was no need to significantly modify technical aspects and that the data is from the last
complete year, and considering that the direct emissions of the manufacturing plant are third-party
verified and included in the PRTR (Spanish National Emissions and Contaminant Sources Registry)
and specifically the GHG emissions are included in the EU Emissions Trade System, the data quality
is considered as high.

Interpretation

As shown in the following chart most of the environmental impacts occur during the
manufacturing stage (A3). This is due to the energy required in the furnace and the chemical
processes occurring in it (mainly decarbonation of limestone).

Thanks to the use of alternative materials and fuels and to the high efficiency of the furnace. the
emissions usually linked to the traditional processes can be reduced significantly. mainly those
related to the direct GHG emissions in the manufacturing of Portland clinker.

The impacts where the raw materials stage (A1) is more relevant are those related to the extraction
of fuels: depletion of abiotic resources (fossil fuels) and ozone depletion. Those impacts are not
relevant in the A3 stage because no CFCs are present during the manufacturing process and the
extraction of fossil fuels is accounted in the A1 stage.
