INTRODUCTION

Cement is a key ingredient in the most commonliy used building
material in the world. Each year in New Zealand, over ZL.5 million tonnes
of traditional cement is used, generating 1.23 million tonnes of CO:.1

This clearly demonstrates both the essential need for construction materials now and in the future, as
well as the necessity for the construction materials industry to be a leading part of the solution
addressing climate change.

With Aotearoa committed to net zero by 2050, Holcim New Zealand is building progress for a lower
carbon footprint in the built environment.

For us, building progress means a complete range of low carbon, high-performance, and specialty
cement and cement binders suitable for Aotearoa’s homes, buildings, and infrastructure. It means
advice, tools and resources to help you specify your next project with confidence. It means solutions
that are right for you each and every time.

Together, we can build better
to help decarbonise Aotearoa.

1 International Energy Agency (IEA) report "The Future of Cement in a Carbon-Constrained World"(2018); Cement and
Concrete Association of New Zealand - Key Facts and Figures; The International Energy Agency (IEA) Cement Technology
Roadmap 2009 estimates that the production of 1 tonne of cement results in the emission of approximately 0.82 tonnes
of CO. Using the conversion factor of 0.82 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of cement, the production of 1.5 million tonnes of
cement in New Zealand would result in the emission of approximately 1.23 million tonnes of CO. The actual amount of
CO2emissions may vary.

LOW CARBON CEMENT

IN NEW ZEALAND

HOLCIM NZ’'S CEMENT AT À GLANCE

Holcim NZ provides project-specific, on-demand
Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) to customers.
This capability represents a significant step in Holcim NZ's
sustainability journey and embodies our multi-disciplinary
approach to embedding sustainability into our
organisation and operations. With the introduction of our
cement blends, third-party verified data will underpin our
capability to work with our customers from tender through
to design and construction to optimise sustainability
performance.

Holcim NZ's cement blend is backed by an EPD Process
Certification. It's not only a first for cement, but a first for
any product in New Zealand. Our EPD Process Certification
is a stamp of approval to produce compliant EPDs in-
house, opening up significant capability and flexibility in
producing and using life cycle impact data to inform our
operations and our customers.

To gain our EPD Process Certification, Holcim invested in
embedding Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) into our systems
and processes. We have satisfied a rigorous, third-party
evaluation in accordance with the relevant ISO standards
and guidelines of the International EPD Program and EPD
Australasia. ?

This EPD has been developed using our EPD Process
Certification for GENERAL PURPOSE PORTLAND CEMENT
(ULTRACEM) with production occurring within New
Zealand.

LCA INFORMATION

Declared Unit

1 tonne of cement blend.

Reference Service Life (RSL)

The RSL is not specified as the scope is from cradle to gate
with distribution (module A4) option.

Time Representativeness

The plant data for the LCA is based on 2021 calendar year
production data. The mix data for the LCA is based on
2023 calendar year production data.

Databases and LCA Software Used

SimaPro® LCA software (v 9.4) was used for the LCA
modelling which developed the LCA Calculator, used as
per the certified EPD Process. It uses background data
from:

1. The Australian Life Cycle Inventory Database (AusLCI
v1.39) (2022)

2. Ecoinvent 3.8 (2021)

The environmental impacts modelled from the existing
EPDs do not include impacts for the additional Green Star
(v1.2) impact categories included in the environmental
impact tables. The following impact categories were
calculated manually for the foreground data:

e Use of renewable primary energy resources used as raw
materials

e Use of non-renewable primary energy, excluding non-
renewable primary energy resources used as raw
materials

e Use of secondary materials
e Use of renewable secondary fuels

ee Use of non-renewable secondary fuels

3 Australian Life Cycle Inventory Database Initiative
(AuSLCI). (2022). Guidelines for Data Development for an
Australian Life Cycle Inventory Database, Data Standard.

Allocation

Allocation was necessary to proportion inputs and outputs
to intermediate flows and processes at the plant level. As
much as possible, intermediate flows were allocated
physically based on the weight of cement.

Ground granulated blast furnace slag from steel blast
furnace production was allocated economically. Please
refer to the “Recycled Material” section for further detail.

Cut-Off Criteria

No flows were excluded on the basis of cut-off criteria.

Data Quality

Data quality for the foreground data was assessed in terms
of geographic and temporal representativeness. Al data
sources were scored medium or higher.

Background data sources were also assessed with respect
to their timeliness, with all data sources being updated
within the 10 years required under PCR 2019:14.

DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM BOUNDARIES
AND EXCLUDED LIFECYCLE STAGES

The scope of the LCA and EPD is from cradle to gate (A1-A3).
Life cycle stages beyond Holcim's gate are excluded from the LCA (see figure below).

Environmental impacts relating to personnel, infrastructure and production equipment not directly
consumed in the process are excluded from the system boundary as per the Product Category Rules

(2019:14 Construction Production and Construction Services).

Content Declaration

The following table provides a summary of the materials included in Holcim's cement and their
relative composition by weight. The gross weight of this declared material makes up a minimum of

99% of the products covered by this EPD.

Packaging

Holcim cement is delivered in either
bulk or packaging.

Recycled Material

BS EN 16757:2017 specifically lists the
following materials relevant to the
study as co-products:

e Fly ash:;

° Ground granulated blast furnace
slag; and

As such, the above materials are
considered as co-products of their
production process and the impacts
for their production process are
allocated according to PCR 2019:14
Construction Products and
Construction Services (co-produced
goods, multi-output allocation).

Default background data from LCA
databases was used to model the

above co-products:

°e Fly ash: AUSLCI process for fly ash
treats it as a waste material and
only includes transport impacts.

° Ground granulated blast furnace
slag: the AusLCI process for slag is
allocated based on economic
value, as the product has a
significant economic value at the

point of collection.

The allocation approach of the AusLCI
LCA database was adopted as a
default for secondary data and
processes (eg. secondary fuel in
cement production). The AusLCI
dataset conforms to EN 15804 when
applying allocation to its various
processes and sub-processes.
