INTRODUCTION

Cement is a key ingredient in the most commonly used building
material in the world. Each year in New Zealand, over 1.5 million tonnes
of traditional cement is used, generating 1.23 million tonnes of CO:.1

This clearly demonstrates both the essential need for construction materials now and in the future, as
well as the necessity for the construction materials industry to be a leading part of the solution
addressing climate change.

With Aotearoa committed to net zero by 2050, Holcim New Zealand is building progress for a lower
carbon footprint in the built environment.

For us, building progress means a complete range of low carbon, high-performance, and specialty
cement and cement binders suitable for Aotearoa's homes, buildings, and infrastructure. It means
advice, tools and resources to help you specify your next project with confidence. It means solutions
that are right for you each and every time.

Together, we can build better
to help decarbonise Aotearoa.

1 International Energy Agency (IEA) report "The Future of Cement in a Carbon-Constrained World"(2018); Cement and
Concrete Association of New Zealand - Key Facts and Figures; The International Energy Agency (IEA) Cement Technology
Roadmap 2009 estimates that the production of 1 tonne of cement results in the emission of approximately 0.82 tonnes
of CO. Using the conversion factor of 0.82 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of cement, the production of 1.5 million tonnes of
cement in New Zealand would result in the emission of approximately 1.23 million tonnes of CO. The actual amount of
CO2emissions may vary.

the environmental impact of our products.

Globally, Holcim is 60,000 people around the world who
are passionate about building progress for people and the
planet through four business segments: Cement, Ready-
Mix Concrete, Aggregates and Solutions & Products.

Sustainability is at the core of our global strategy, with our
industry's first 2030 and 2050 net-zero targets validated by D»

DUNEDIN

the Science Based Targets initiative for all scopes. We are
leading the transition towards low-carbon construction
and driving a circular economy by providing materials and
solutions that are re-shaping the way our industry builds.
Holcim NZ has developed a range of low carbon cements
and cement replacements specifically for the New Zealand
market.

HOLCIM NZ’'S CEMENT AT À GLANCE

Holcim NZ provides project-specific, on-demand
Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) to customers.
This capability represents a significant step in Holcim NZ's
sustainability journey and embodies our multi-disciplinary
approach to embedding sustainability into our
organisation and operations. With the introduction of our
cement blends, third-party verified data will underpin our
capability to work with our customers from tender through
to design and construction to optimise sustainability
performance.

Holcim NZ's cementitious materials are backed by an EPD
Process Certification. It's not only a first for cement, but a
first for any product in New Zealand. Our EPD Process
Certification is a stamp of approval to produce compliant
EPDs in-house, opening up significant capability and
flexibility in producing and using life cycle impact data to
inform our operations and our customers.

To gain our EPD Process Certification, Holcim invested in
embedding Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) into our systems
and processes. We have satisfied a rigorous, third-party
evaluation in accordance with the relevant ISO standards
and guidelines of the International EPD Program and EPD
Australasia. 2?

This EPD has been developed using our EPD Process
Certification for NORTH ISLAND - AUCKLAND -
ENVIROCORE 100 with production occurring at
AUCKLAND.

LCA INFORMATION

Declared Unit

1 tonne of cementitious material

Reference Service Life (RSL)

The RSL is not specified as the scope is from cradle to gate
with distribution (module A4) option.

Time Representativeness

The plant data for the LCA is based on 2021 calendar year
production data. The mix data for the LCA is based on
2021 calendar year production data.

Databases and LCA Software Used

SimaPro® LCA software (v 9.4) was used for the LCA
modelling which developed the LCA Calculator, used as
per the certified EPD Process. It uses background data
from:

1. The Australian Life Cycle Inventory Database (AusLCI
v1.39) (2022)

2. Ecoinvent 3.8 (2021)

The environmental impacts modelled from the existing
EPDs do not include impacts for the additional Green Star
(v1.2) impact categories included in the environmental
impact tables. The following impact categories were
calculated manually for the foreground data:

ee __ Use of renewable primary energy resources used as raw
materials

e __ Use of non-renewable primary energy, excluding non-
renewable primary energy resources used as raw
materials

e Use of secondary materials
e Use of renewable secondary fuels

e Use of non-renewable secondary fuels

(AuSLCI). (2022). Guidelines for Data Development for an
Australian Life Cycle Inventory Database, Data Standard.

LCA INFORMATION

Allocation

Allocation was necessary to proportion inputs and outputs
to intermediate flows and processes at the plant level. As
much as possible, intermediate flows were allocated
physically based on the weight of cement.

Ground granulated blast furnace slag from steel blast
furnace production was allocated economically. Please
refer to the “Recycled Material” section for further detail.

Cut-Off Criteria

No flows were excluded on the basis of cut-off criteria.

Data Quality

Data quality for the foreground data was assessed in terms
of geographic and temporal representativeness. Al data
sources were scored medium or higher.

Background data sources were also assessed with respect
to their timeliness, with all data sources being updated
within the 10 years required under PCR 2019:14.

DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM BOUNDARIES
AND EXCLUDED LIFECYCLE STAGES

The scope of the LCA and EPD is from cradle to gate (A1-A4). Life cycle stages beyond Holcim's gate
are excluded from the LCA (see figure below).

Packaging Default background data from LCA databases was
used to model the above co-products:
Holcim cement is delivered in either bulk or
packaging. e Fly ash: AusLCI process for fly ash treats it as a
waste material and only includes transport
impacts.

Recycled Material
e Ground granulated blast furnace slag: the

BS EN 16757:2017 specifically lists the following AusLCI process for slag is allocated based on

materials relevant to the study as co-products: economic value, as the product has a
significant economic value at the point of

+ Flyash; collection.

°__ Ground granulated blast furnace slag; and The allocation approach of the AusLCI LCA

database was adopted as a default for secondary
data and processes (eg. secondary fuel in cement
production). The AusLCI dataset conforms to EN
15804 when applying allocation to its various
processes and sub-processes.

As such, the above materials are considered as co-
products of their production process and the
impacts for their production process are allocated
according to PCR 2019:14 Construction Products
and Construction Services (co-produced goods,
multi-output allocation).
