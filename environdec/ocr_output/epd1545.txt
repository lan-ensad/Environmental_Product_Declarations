Programme information and verification

An Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) is a standardised way of quantifying the potential environmental impacts of
a product or system. EPDs are produced according to a consistent set of rules — Product Category Rules (PCR) — that
define the requirements within a given product category. These rules are a key part of ISO 14025 as they enable
transparency and comparability between EPDs. This EPD provides environmental indicators for precast and prestressed
steel-reinforced concrete products manufactured at Humes' production facilities across Australia. This EPD is a “cradle-to-
gate” declaration covering production of the precast concrete products and their supply chain.

This EPD covers the vast majority of our product
range. The only products that have been excluded
are steel reinforced concrete pipes (these are
covered by Humes EPD S-P-00998) and specialty
products that contain significant quantities of
other materials (i.e. metals other than reinforcing
steel and various polymer materials) that are not
covered in this EPD. Examples of such products are
our standard HumeGard® and HumeCeptor®
range as well as other products that can be lined.
The concrete and reinforcement components of
these example specialty products can be calculated
by this EPD however these products contain a
significant proportion of other materials like
stainless steel, fibreglass and polyethylene that is
not covered by this EPD.

Precast concrete products and pipes are classified
as non-dangerous goods according to the
Australian Code for the Transport of Dangerous
Goods by Road and Rail.

The products included in this EPD do not contain
any substances of very high concern as defined by
European REACH regulation in concentrations
>0.1% (m/m). Dust from this product is classified
as Hazardous according to the Approved Criteria
for Classifying Hazardous Substances 3" Edition
(NOHSC 2004). When concrete products are cut,
sawn, abraded or crushed, dust is created which
contains crystalline silica, some of which may be
respirable (particles small enough to go into the
deep parts of the lung when breathed in), and
which is hazardous. Exposure through inhalation
should be avoided.

Precast and prestressed concrete products form
part of the UN CPC 375 — “Concrete” industry
classification and the ANZSIC 2034 — "Concrete
Product Manufacturing” product group
classification.

Product Stages

Raw Material Stage A1

All raw materials used in the production of Humes
Concrete Products comply with (but not limited to)
the following Australian Standards:

e AS/NZS 3972: General purpose and blended
cements (SA 2010)

e AS 3582 Parts 1, 2 and 3 Supplementary
cementitious materials (SA 2016)

. AS/NZS 4671 Steel reinforcing materials (SA
2019)

. AS 4672.1:2007 Steel prestressing materials
(SA 2007)

e AS 2758.1 Aggregates and rock for
engineering purposes Part 1: Concrete
Aggregates (SA 2014)

e AS 1478 Chemical admixtures for concrete,
mortar and grout (SA 2000)

Transportation Stage A2

Raw materials are transported to our site via
articulated trucks, rigid trucks, barges and rail. The
impact of transportation is determined from the
specific supply sources for each site.

StormWwater pits

Manufacturing Stage A3

The typical manufacturing process of Humes
Concrete Products is by casting specially
formulated concrete into a reusable steel mould.
Compaction is predominantly achieved by utilising
Self Compacting Concrete (SCC), a special type of
concrete which can be placed and consolidated
under its own weight without vibration; however
where normal slumping concrete is required
compaction is achieved by conventional external
form and internal vibrators. The freshly poured
concrete and mould is then cured in a temperature
and humidity-controlled environment to accelerate
concrete curing before the product is removed
from the mould. After removal from the mould the
product is transferred to the outdoor yard storage
area where it continues to cure until it is approved
by final quality checks and transported to the
installation site.

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) Methodology

Background Data

Primary data have been collected for the 2019
calendar year (CY2019) for all sites, with the
exception of Tamworth for which data cover
financial year 2019 (FY19) (1 July 2018 — 30 June
2019). They have been sourced directly from
Humes’ factories that manufacture precast and
prestressed products. Background data have
predominantly been sourced from AusLCI and the
AusLCI shadow database. Data for reinforcing steel
(bars, mesh, wire) have been sourced from our
supplier's EPDs (registration numbers S-P-00855
v1.1, S-P-00857 v1.1, S-P-00858 v1.1) (InfraBuild
2020a-c) where we source steel from InfraBuild. At
some locations we source reinforcement steel (bar,
mesh, wire, strand) from other suppliers, who
import the steel. As specific data on the supply
chain are not publicly available, we have used
ecoinvent v3 data to estimate the impacts of the
various types of reinforcement steel. For transport
of imported steel, we assumed shipping from
Singapore to the concrete plant's closest major
port. Data for admixtures have been sourced from
five EPDs published in December 2015 by EFCA
(European Federation of Concrete Admixtures
Associations Ltd.) (EFCA 2015a-e). As a result, the
vast majority of the environmental profiles of our
products are based on life cycle data that have
been updated in the last five years. Background
data used are less than 10 years old.

Methodological choices have been applied in line
with EN 15804 (CEN 2013); deviations have been
recorded.

Explanation of Averages

Humes produces a large number of precast products,
each with unique characteristics (e.g. class, length,
height, width, thickness) and composition (concrete
composition, steel reinforcement content). After careful
consideration of the range of precast and prestressed
products produced by Humes in Australia, it was
decided to present results separately for concrete and
steel reinforcement on a mass basis. This allows the user
to calculate the impacts of a product when the mass of
concrete and steel reinforcement is given. We have
included product tables for key products in this EPD. For
other products, dimensions and compositions may vary
by production location or state, and as a result no
standard conversions are provided. Please contact your
local Humes site for information on product
composition if the product is not listed in this EPD.

The results are presented for each of our ten production
locations. Locations will typically produce more than
one mix-design, so we have presented multiple options
for concrete mixes. Where we use different mix designs
with similar cement content (<+10% variation in kg/m*
cement content), we have grouped these. The use of
steel bar, mesh, wire, strand and galvanised bar is
product specific. We provide an average environmental
profile per kg of steel reinforcement per site. The
differences between sites are the result of different
shares of the type of reinforcement combined with
differences in the supply chains.

This presentation format reduces the variation for each
product's environmental profile, as it allows the user to
calculate the environmental profile according to the

exact product composition and manufacturing location.

Precast & Prestressed Concrete

Allocation

The key processes that require allocation are:

e Production of precast concrete products and
precast concrete pipes: All shared processes
are attributed to concrete products based on
their mass.

e Use of fly ash: All environmental impacts of
the power plant have been allocated to the
main product: electricity; fly ash has only
received the burdens of the transport to our
sites

e Use of slag: We applied economic co-
product allocation, attributing 0.3% of the
environmental impacts of pig iron
production to the slag. Energy for drying and
grinding slag into ground granulated blast
furnace slag (GGBFS) are added separately.

e Use of silica fume: We applied economic co-
product allocation, attributing 4.8% of the
environmental impacts of metallurgical grade
silicon production to the silica fume (Timm et
al 2019).

e Use of steel scrap in reinforcement steel:
Recycling allocation has followed the polluter
pays principle in line with EN 15804 and the
PCR. See InfraBuild's EPDs (S-P-00855; S-P-
00857 and S-P-00858) of reinforcing
products (InfraBuild 2020a-c).

Cut-off Criteria

e The contribution of capital goods
(production equipment and infrastructure)
and personnel is outside the scope of the
LCA, in line with the PCR (Environdec 20203).

e The amount of packaging used for
admixtures, lifters, bar chairs and mould oil
is well below the materiality cut-off, so
packaging materials and quantities have
therefore been estimated only.

Key Assumptions

This EPD covers precast concrete products
manufactured using normal slumping concrete
and Self Compacting Concrete (SCC) by Humes in
Australia. The concrete composition is taken from
Humes's internal operating systems. Some (<10%)
of concrete is supplied by neighbouring concrete
plants that are not owned by Humes. We have
used the exact concrete composition for both in-
house manufactured and imported concrete.

Individual products may contain à combination of
different types of reinforcement steel (bar, mesh,
wire, strand, galvanised bar). We have used the
weighted average type of steel per site to report
reinforcement steel impacts.

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) results

The background LCA serves as the foundation for this
EPD. An LCA analyses the environmental processes in
the value chain of a product. It provides a
comprehensive evaluation of all upstream material
and energy inputs and outputs. The results are
provided for a range of environmental impact
categories, in line with EN 15804 (CEN 2013).

Declared unit

Precast and prestressed reinforced concrete products
are available in numerous shapes and sizes. Multiple
products can be presented collectively (grouped) if
the variation between their environmental profiles is
within +10%.

Table 3: Environmental indicators

Precast concrete products are generally
manufactured using one or two routine concrete

mixes. Our sites also have the ability to use high early

strength mixes and project-specific mixes.

A large number of permutations have been included
based on the following declared unit:

1 tonne of precast (or prestressed) reinforced
concrete product.

After careful consideration, we determined that
presenting the results for concrete and reinforcement
steel separately would best limit any variations in
environmental profiles while providing a clear
pathway for users of the EPD to calculate the impacts
per declared unit across hundreds of product
permutations.

Examples of how to calculate the profile of a specific product
(Examples provided are for GWP. Repeat this process for each indicator.)

Product and production location

Example 1: Small box culvert
1200 x 1200 x 2.4m, supplied
from Pooraka in Adelaide

Example 2: Humes deck, 15m
long, supplied from Townsville

Step 1: Look up the product
composition in the Product
Specifications section (from page 26);
or consult your local Humes supplier
for the product's compositional
details if not included in this EPD.

Small box culverts are found in
table 19, which shows a 1200 x
1200 product contains 1.05 m° of
concrete and 79 kg of steel
reinforcement.

Humes decks are found in table 16,
which shows a 15m long deck
contains 5.11 m° of concrete and

324 kg of steel reinforcement and
283 kg steel strand.

Step 2: Ask your Humes supplier
which mix design is used for your
products. The default is Routine Mix.

Check density for the relevant mix
(first row of table 12 for Adelaide
(Pooraka) routine mix): 2400 kg/m°

Check density for the relevant mix
(first row of table 9 for Townsville

routine mix): 2380 kg/m

Step 3: Look up the environmental
profiles for the concrete and steel for
the supplying site in the tables on
the following pages.

Adelaide (Pooraka) is shown in
table 12:

Routine mix: 2.35E+02 kg COe/t
Reo steel: 1.18E+00 kg COe/kg

Townsville is shown in table 9:
Routine mix: 2.21E+02 kg COe/t

Reo steel: 1.74 +00 kg COe/kg
Strand steel: 3.19E+00 kg CO2e/kg

Step 4: Multiply the volume of
concrete by the density of the
concrete mix and the environmental
indicator values for the concrete. For
steel, multiply the quantity of steel by
the environmental indicator values
for steel.

Concrete: 1.05 m5 x 2.4 t/mÿ x
2.35E+02 kg COze/t

= 5.92E+02 kg CO2e

Steel: 79 kg x 1.18E+00 kg COe/kg
= 9.32E+01 kg CO2e

Concrete: 5.11 m° x 2.38 t/m° x
2.21E+02 kg CO2e/t

= 2.69E+03 kg CO2e

Reo steel: 324 kg x 1.74E+00 kg
CO2e/kg = 5.64E+02 kg COze
Strand: 283 kg x 3.19E+00 kg
CO2e/kg = 9.03E+02 kg CO2e

Step 5: Add the concrete and steel
results to get to the reinforced
concrete product.

5.92E+02 + 9.32E+01

= 6.85E+02 kg CO2e

(this is 685 kg COze for one Small
box culvert 1200 x 1200 x 2.4m,
supplied from Pooraka)

2.69E+03 + 9.03E+02

= 3.59E+03 kg CO2e

(this is 3,590 kg CO2e for one 15m
long Humes deck, supplied from
Townsville)

Other environmental information

Our safety, health and environment (SHE) management system aims to achieve high environmental
standards. The Holcim executive committee closely monitors our performance in managing workplace safety
and protection of the environment. The environmental component of the management system helps identify
and manage potential environmental risks. Operations are assessed against the requirements and
improvements made.

Infrastructure Sustainability

The Infrastructure Sustainability Council of Australia (ISCA) is the peak industry body for advancing
sustainability in Australia's infrastructure. As a division of Holcim Australia, Humes is a member of ISCA and
takes an interest and role in developing sustainable practises across design, construction and operation of
infrastructure.

ISCA has developed the Infrastructure Sustainability (IS) rating scheme which is Australia's only
comprehensive rating scheme for evaluating sustainability for infrastructure. IS evaluates the sustainability of
infrastructure projects and assets and assigns credits across a number of categories which incentivise the use
of sustainable practises.

Humes helps its customers optimise their IS ratings through smart selection and design of precast products.

This is our third Environmental Product Declaration. Earlier this year we developed an ISO 14025 and EN
15804 compliant EPD for Humes Tamworth precast concrete for infrastructure applications and in 2016 we
developed an ISO 14025 and EN 15804 compliant EPD for our reinforced concrete pipe products. These EPDs
are publicly available on the EPD Australasia website:

Product Specifications

The following tables are provided so the potential environmental impact can be calculated for a specific
concrete volume and steel content weight. The values in the tables represents the product's steel mass and
concrete volume that can be converted to a weight in tonnes with the associated sites concrete density so
that the results of the LCA can be converted to product units. Please note that these product weights cover a
mixture of standard products and examples of elements that typically have unique specified designs.
Concrete volumes and steel weights for non-standard products can usually be found in Issued For
Manufacturer (FM) drawings, and can also be used for determining LCA results using this EPD document.

See example calculation on page 13.

Table 15: Example product groups for which specifications are provided in this EPD

Prestressed piles, decks and girders Humes manufacture a wide range of prestressed bridge componentry to
meet road and rail authority specifications, including beams, decks and
planks, I-beams, girders, and piles (rectangular precast concrete section
and hexagonal prestressed units).

Headwalls Humes manufacture a range of standard headwalls to conform to the
requirements of individual state and local authorities. Humes also
manufacture multiple cell headwalls (for both pipes and box culverts),
sloping headwalls and end walls, small box culvert headwalls, and
compact headwalls. Where a project requires specific needs, we will work
with you to develop a cost-effective headwall design to meet the needs of
your project.

Box Culverts Humes manufacture a full range of box culvert and uni-culvert sizes (from
300mm to 6,600mm) and configurations to Australian Standards AS1597
(parts one and two). Box culverts are generally available in standard
lengths of 1.22m and 2.46m (or 1.2m and 2.4m QLD). In many cases
Humes has the facility to manufacture larger span and leg heights beyond
those indicated in the Australian Standards. Humes also manufacture
custom designs such as splayed box culverts, post-tensioning stressing
etc.

StormTrap® The StormTrap® system is an underground trafficable stormwater
detention and infiltration solution that provides a high level of value for
customers and projects in meeting regulatory requirements, whilst
minimising the impact on land usability.

HumeDeck® HumeDeck® bridge system is a modular precast solution for small to
medium sized bridges spanning up to 12 m.

Precast & Prestressed Concrete

25
Custom Pits Humes manufacture a wide range of custom and modular concrete
stormwater pits; our range includes lids, grates and covers, base units and
risers, and a variety of street furniture to suit different applications and
local requirements. Our ability to customise components to suit each
project provides design flexibility and economy for installers.

Sleepers Humes has over 50 years’ experience in the provision of prestressed and
precast concrete railway sleepers for heavy haulage, mainline, secondary
and high-speed tracks across Australia. We provide a range of standard,
dual and narrow-gauge sleepers for applications including grain,
electrical, transponder, pedestrian, transition and DED sleepers.

Storage Wall Units Humes manufacture two modular cantilever storage wall systems (the L
wall and the T wall) for internal or external retainment, separation, or
confinement of bulk materials of all kinds.

Arches Arches cover a broad range of spans and heights to accommodate a wide
range of applications including bridges, tunnels and drainage culverts.
