    "product_description": "Holcim Fuerte cement is recommended for preparing general-purpose concretes, and mortars that do not require high initial strength. Its controlled Tricalcium Aluminate (C3A) content of no more than 8%, provides a moderate heat of hydration which favors the reduction of surface cracking due to shrinkage, when the curing parameters are adequately controlled. The inclusion of high-grade Holcim Limestone gives it better attributes in terms of plasticity in the fresh state of the mixtures, and reduces the water requirement to reach the desired workability parameters.",
