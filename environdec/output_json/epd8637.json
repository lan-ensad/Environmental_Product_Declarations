The study does not exclude any hazardous materials or substances. This is a cradle to gate EPD. The product is exempted of declaring modules C1-C4 and D because it fulfills the 3 conditions stated in EN 15804. End of life scenarios can be found in EPD for concrete and mortar. The study includes all major raw material and energy consumption. All inputs and outputs of the unit processes, for which data is available for, are included in the calculation. There is no neglected unit process more than 1% of total mass or energy flows. The module specific total neglected input and output flows also do not exceed 5% of energy usage or mass.",
    "allocation_estimates_assumptions": "Allocation is required if some material, energy, and waste data cannot be measured separately for the product under investigation. In this study, as per EN 15804, allocation is conducted in the following order: 1. Allocation should be avoided. 2. Allocation should be based on physical properties (e.g. mass, volume) when the difference in revenue is small. 3. Allocation should be based on economic values. In this study allocation is made by mass. Allocation used in Ecoinvent 3.6 environmental data sources follows the methodology ‘allocation, cut-off by classification’. This methodology is in line with the requirements of the EN 15804 -standard.",

In this stage, raw materials considered are clinker, gypsum, limestone, fly ashes, slag, pozzolana and additive. Packaging material is not considered as dispatch is done by truck. Electricity used is from the national network. Water is used in a closed circuit and is allocated to clinker production. Waste in the cement blending and crushing process are recirculated inside the factory.",
