DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCT AND SCOPE

This EPD is prepared for products classified as UN CPC Group 3744-Cement or CSI MasterFormat
Division 03 30 00 Cast-in-Place Concrete.

This EPD is primary reported Holcim data from the reference year 2021. It reports on the six cement
mixes produced at the Ronco cement plant, made from primarily limestone. These six cement mixes
make up 100% of yearly production at the Ronco cement plant. Cement from the Ronco cement plant
is used in the EPDs for concrete mixes in El Salvador concrete plants. This plant is not a grinding
operation.

This LCA assumes the impacts from products manufactured in accordance with the standards outlined
in this report. This LCA is a cradle-to-gate study, and therefore, stages extending beyond the plant
gate are not included in this LCA. Excluded stages include transportation of the manufactured material
to the construction site; on-site construction processes and components; building (infrastructure) use
and maintenance: and “end-of-life” effects.

CEMENT DESIGN SUMMARY

For this LCA the manufacturing plant, owned and operated by Holcim El Salvador, is located at their
Ronco Cement facility in El Salvador. All operating data is formulated using the actual data from Holcim
El Salvador's plant at the above location, including Water, energy consumption and waste generation.
All inputs for this system boundary are calculated for the plant.

This life cycle inventory Was organized in a spreadsheet and was then input into an RStudio
environment where pre-calculated LCIA results for relevant products/activities stemming from the
ecoinvent v3.6 database and a local EPD database in combination With primary data from Holcim El
Salvador were utilized. Explanations of the contribution of each data source to this study are outlined
in the section ‘Data Sources and Quality.

ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION

CUT-OFF CRITERIA

ISO 14044:2006 and the focus PCR requires the LCA model to contain a minimum of 95% of the total
inflows (mass and energy) to the upstream and core modules be included in this study. The cut-off
criteria were applied to all other processes unless otherwise noted above as follows. À 1% cut-off is
considered for all renewable and non-renewable primary energy consumption and the total mass of
inputs within a unit process where the total of the neglected inputs does not exceed 5%.

DATA SOURCES AND DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

Raw material transport: À combination of actual mode/distance combinations were assumed for key
bulk materials whereas ecoinvent default multi-modal market mix distances were assumed for other
inputs where no original data could be provided.

Electricity: Electricity consumption values are for Holcim El Salvador in calendar year 2021. These
values were direct reported from Holcim El Salvador records. The unit process “market for electricity,
medium voltage/electricity, medium voltage/SV/KWh" was used to represent the El Salvador grid
electricity used by the Ronco cement plant.

Process/space heating: Not applicable

Fuel required for machinery: Machinery-related fuel requirements were determined from direct
Holcim information for fuel use outside the kiln. Direct emission calculations for propane were
calculated with ecoinvent 3.8-unit processes normalized to the amount of fuel used per ton of cement.

Waste generation: Waste generation values are directly reported from Holcim operations for both
bulk waste and hazardous waste. No High-level radioactive waste is generated on-site at this facility

Recovered energy: Not applicable

Recycled/reused material/components: Any recycled or reused materials are detailed in the A1
input table.

Module A1 material Losses: Due to lack of data, default loss factors were assumed: À broad 2% \vaste
factor was used throughout this study.

Direct A3 emissions accounting: Holcim El Salvador does not report their direct emissions therefore
the only Holcim calculation used for emissions was the decarbonization of the clinker at the kiln. AlL
other emissions, both the kiln emissions ad outside the kiln, were modeled using ecoinvent unit
processes.

Waste transport requirements: Due to lack of data, default loss factors were assumed. Market
transportation was chosen to represent the removal of waste from the plant. The actual destination is
not always known therefore exact numbers could not be used.

DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

Data quality/variability requirements, as specified in the PCR, are applied. This section describes the
achieved data quality relative to the ISO 14044:2006 requirements. Data quality is judged based on its
precision (measured, calculated, or estimated), completeness (e.g. unreported emissions), consistency
(degree of uniformity of the methodology applied within a study serving as a data source) and
representativeness (geographical, temporal, and technological).

Precision: Through measurement and calculation, the manufacturers collected and provided primary
data on their annual production. For accuracy, the LCA practitioner and 3rd Party Verifier validated the
plant gate-to-gate data.

Completeness: All relevant specific processes, including inputs (raw materials, energy, and ancillary
materials) and outputs (emissions and production volume) were considered and modeled to represent
the specified and declared products. Most relevant background materials and processes Were taken
from ecoinvent V3.8 LCI datasets where relatively recent region-specific electricity inputs were utilizedl.
The most relevant EPDs requiring key A1 inputs were also utilized where readily available.

Consistency: To ensure consistency, the same modeling structure across the respective product
systems was ütilized for allinputs, which consisted of raw material inputs and ancillary material, energy
flows, water resource inputs, product, and co-products outputs, returned and recovered Cement
materials, emissions to air, Water and soil, and waste recycling and treatment. The same background
LCI datasets from the ecoinvent v3.8 database were used across all product systems. Crosschecks
concerning the plausibility of mass and energy flows were continuously conducted. The LCA team
conducted mass and energy balances at the plant and selected process level to maintain a high level
of consistency.

Reproducibility: Internal reproducibility is possible since the data and the models are stored and
available in a machine-readable project file for all foreground and background processes, and in Eco-
Purpose's proprietary Cement LCA calculator' for all production facility and product-specific
calculations. À considerable level of transparency is provided throughout the detailed LCA report as
the specifications and material quantity make-up for the declared products are presented and key

LABELING SUSTAINABILITY | 11

ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION

primary and secondary LCI data sources are summarized. The provision of more detailed publicly
accessible data to allow full external reproducibility was not possible due to reasons of confidentiality.

Label Sustainability has developed a proprietary tool that allows the calculation of PCR-compliant LCA
results for Cement product designs. The tool auto-calculates results by scaling base-unit
Technosphere inputs (i.e., 1 kg sand, 1 KWh electricity, etc.) to replicate the reference flow conversions
that take place in any typical LCA software like openLCA or SimaPro. The tool was tested against
several LCAS performed in openLCA and the tool generated identical results to those realized in
openLCA across every impact category and inventory metric (where comparisons could be readily
made).

Representativeness: The representativeness of the data is summarized as follows.

e Time related coverage of the manufacturing processes’ primary collected data from 2021-
01-01 to 2021-12-31.

e Upstream (background) LCI data was either the PCR specified default (if applicable) or
more appropriate LCI datasets as found in the country-adjusted ecoinvent v3.8 database.

e _Geographical coverage for inputs required by the A3 facility(ies) is representative of its
region of focus; other upstream and background processes are based on US, North
American, or global average data and adjusted to regional electricity mixes when relevant.

e _Technological coverage is typical or average and specific to the participating facilities for
all primary data.

ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS AND INVENTORY METRICS

Per the PCR, this EPD supports the life cycle impact assessment indicators and inventory metrics as
listed in the tables below. As specified in the PCR, the most recent US EPA Tool for the Reduction and
Assessment of Chemical and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI), impact categories were utilized as
they provide a North American context for the mandatory category indicators to be included in the
EPD. Additionally, the PCR requires a set of inventory metrics to be reported with the LCIA indicators
(see tables below).

It should be noted that emerging LCA impact categories and inventory items are still under
development and can have high levels of uncertainty that preclude international acceptance pending
further development. Use caution when interpreting data in any of the following categories.

LIMITATIONS

This EPD is a declaration of potential environmental impact and does not support or provide definitive
comparisons of the environmental performance of specific products. Only EPDSs prepared from cradle-
to-grave life cycle results and based on the same function and reference service life and quantified by
the same functional unit can be used to assist purchasers and users in making informed comparisons
between products.

LCIA results are relative expressions and do not predict impacts on category endpoints, the exceeding
of thresholds, safety margins or risks. Further, LCA offers a wide array of environmental impact
indicators, and this EPD reports a collection of those, as specified by the PCR.

LABELING SUSTAINABILITY | 12

ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION

In addition to the impact results, this EPD provides several metrics related to resource consumption
and waste generation. While these data may be informational in other ways, they do not provide a
measure of impact on the environment.

TOTAL IMPACT SUMMARY

The following table reports the total LCA results for each product produced at the given cement
