Figure 2: General system inputs considered in the product system and categorized by modules in scope

In addition, as according to the relevant PCR, the following requirements are excluded from this
study:

e Production, manufacture, and construction of A3 building/capital goods and
infrastructure.

e Production and manufacture of steel production equipment, steel delivery vehicles,
earth-moving equipment, and laboratory equipment.

e Personnel-related activities (travel, furniture, office supplies),.

e Energy use related to company management and sales activities.

For this LCA the manufacturing plant, owned and operated by Holcim Ecuador, is located at their
Planta Quito Norte facility in Ecuador. Al operating data is formulated using the actual data from
Holcim Ecuador's plant at the above location, including water, energy consumption and waste
generation. Al inputs for this system boundary are calculated for the plant.

This life cycle inventory Was organized in a spreadsheet and was then input into an RStudio
environment where pre-calculated LCIA results for relevant products/activities stemming from the
ecoinvent v3.8 database and a local EPD database in combination with primary data from Holcim
Ecuador were uütilized. Explanations of the contribution of each data source to this study are outlined
in the section ‘Data Sources and Quality’. Further LCI details for each declared product are provided
in the sections ‘Detailed LCI tables’ and ‘Transport tables’ of the detailed LCA report. À parameter
uncertainty analysis was also performed where key statistical results (e.g. min/mean/max etc.) are
provided in the detailed LCA report.

CUT-OFF CRITERIA

ISO 14044:2006 and the focus PCR requires the LCA model to contain a minimum of 95% of the total
inflows (mass and energy) to the upstream and core modules be included in this study. The cut-off

LABELING SUSTAINABILITY | 7

ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION

criteria were applied to all other processes unless otherwise noted above as follows. À 1% cut-off is
considered for all renewable and non-renewable primary energy consumption and the total mass of
inputs within a unit process where the total of the neglected inputs does not exceed 5%.

DATA SOURCES AND DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

Raw material transport: À combination of actual mode/distance combinations were assumed for
key bulk materials whereas ecoinvent default multi-modal market mix distances \were assumed for
other inputs where no original data could be provided.

Electricity: Electricity consumption values are for Holcim Ecuador in calendar year 2021. These
values were direct reported from Holcim records. The unit process “market for electricity, medium
voltage/electricity, medium voltage/EC/kKWh" \vas used to represent the Ecuador grid electricity
used by the concrete plant.

Process/space heating: No process and space heating fuels were used at this plant per primary
Holcim records.

Fuel required for machinery: Machinery-related fuel requirements were determined from direct
Holcim reporting. Diesel fuel is used in generator, pumps for pumping the concrete to high
elevations, equipment for moving materials and loaders.

Waste generation: Waste generation values are directly reported from Holcim operations for both
bulk waste and hazardous. No High-level radioactive waste is generated on-site at this facility.

Recovered energy: not applicable.

Recycled/reused material/components: The amount of returned concrete is based on Holcim
primary data for the reference year, 2021.

Module A1 material Losses: Due to lack of data, default loss factors of 5% Were assumed. The PCR
states ” A3 shall include an assumption of 5% material loss unless product specific data is available
and transparently reported in the project LCA report underlying the EPD;"

Direct A3 emissions accounting: not applicable.

Waste transport requirements: Transportation distances are using estimated values. The waste
hauler cannot guarantee the exact distances traveled due to the variation of route and actual location
of disposal. Most waste disposal sites are near the plant therefore the 25 km distance is a
representative estimate. Also included are the values for concrete returned and \Wwash water,
measured in kilograms.

Product transport requirements: The diesel fuel used by the mixing trucks is direct primary
information reported from Holcim records for the year 2021. Per the reference concrete PCR, 30% of
the fuel used is allocated to stage A3 (manufacturing)for material mixing.

DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

Data quality/variability requirements, as specified in the PCR, are applied. This section describes the
achieved data quality relative to the ISO 14044:2006 requirements. Data quality is judged based on its
precision (measured, calculated, or estimated), completeness (e.g. unreported emissions),
consistency (degree of uniformity of the methodology applied within a study serving as a data
source) and representativeness (geographical, temporal, and technological).

Precision: Through measurement and calculation, the manufacturers collected and provided primary
data on their annual production. For accuracy, the LCA practitioner and 3rd Party Verifier validated
the plant gate-to-gate data.

Completeness: All relevant specific processes, including inputs (raw materials, energy, and ancillary
materials) and outputs (emissions and production volume) were considered and modeled to
represent the specified and declared products. The majority of relevant background materials and
processes were taken from ecoinvent v3.8 LCI datasets where relatively recent region-specific
electricity inputs were utilized. The most relevant EPDs requiring key A1 inputs were also utilized
where readily available.

Consistency: To ensure consistency, the same modeling structure across the respective product
systems was utilized for all inputs, which consisted of raw material inputs and ancillary material,
energy flows, water resource inputs, product, and co-products outputs, returned and recovered
ready mix concrete materials, emissions to air, Water and soil, and waste recycling and treatment.
The same background LCI datasets from the ecoinvent v3.8 database were used across all product
systems. Crosschecks concerning the plausibility of mass and energy flows were continuously
conducted. The LCA team conducted mass and energy balances at the plant and selected process
level to maintain a high level of consistency.

Reproducibility: Internal reproducibility is possible since the data and the models are stored and
available in a machine readable project file for all foreground and background processes, and in
Labeling Sustainability's proprietary Ready Mix Concrete LCA calculator’ for all production facility
and product-specific calculations. À considerable level of transparency is provided throughout the
detailed LCA report as the specifications and material quantity make-up for the declared products
are presented and key primary and secondary LCI data sources are summarized. The provision of
more detailed publicly accessible data to allow full external reproducibility was not possible due to

reasons of confidentiality.

‘Labeling Sustainability has developed a proprietary tool that allows the calculation of PCR-
compliant LCA results for ready mix cocnrete product designs. The tool auto-calculates results by
scaling base-unit technosphere inputs (ie. 1 kg sand, 1 KWh electricity, etc.) to replicate the reference
flow conversions that take place in any typical LCA software like openLCA or SimaPro. The tool was
tested against several LCAs performed in openLCA and the tool generated identical results to those
realized in openLCA across every impact category and inventory metric (where comparisons could
be readily made).

LABELING SUSTAINABILITY | 10

ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION

Representativeness: The representativeness of the data is summarized as follows.

e Time related coverage of the manufacturing processes’ primary collected data from
2021-01-01 to 2021-12-31.

e _ Upstream (background) LCI data was either the PCR specified default (if applicable) or
more appropriate LCI datasets as found in the country-adjusted ecoinvent v3.8 database.

e _Geographical coverage for inputs required by the A3 facility(ies) is representative of its
region of focus; other upstream and background processes are based on US, North
American, or global average data and adjusted to regional electricity mixes when
relevant.

e Technological coverage is typical or average and specific to the participating facilities for
all primary data.

ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS AND INVENTORY METRICS

Per the PCR, this EPD supports the life cycle impact assessment indicators and inventory metrics as
listed in the tables below. As specified in the PCR, the most recent US EPA Tool for the Reduction
and Assessment of Chemical and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI), impact categories were
utilized as they provide a North American context for the mandatory category indicators to be
included in the EPD. Additionally, the PCR requires a set of inventory metrics to be reported with the
LCIA indicators.

It should be noted that emerging LCA impact categories and inventory items are still under
development and can have high levels of uncertainty that preclude international acceptance
pending further development. Use caution when interpreting data in any of the following categories.

LIMITATIONS

This EPD is a declaration of potential environmental impact and does not support or provide
definitive comparisons of the environmental performance of specific products. Only EPDS prepared
from cradle-to-grave life cycle results and based on the same function and reference service life and
quantified by the same functional unit can be used to assist purchasers and users in making informed
comparisons between products.

LCIA results are relative expressions and do not predict impacts on category endpoints, the
exceeding of thresholds, safety margins or risks. Further, LCA offers a wide array of environmental
impact indicators, and this EPD reports a collection of those, as specified by the PCR.

In addition to the impact results, this EPD provides several metrics related to resource consumption
and waste generation. While these data may be informational in other ways, they do not provide a
measure of impact on the environment.

TOTAL IMPACT SUMMARY

The following table reports the total LCA results for each product produced at the given ready mix
concrete facility on a per 1m3 of concrete basis.
