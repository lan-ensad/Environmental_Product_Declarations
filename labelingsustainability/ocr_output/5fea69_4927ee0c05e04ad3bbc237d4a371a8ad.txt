COMPANY DESCRIPTION

Holcim Argentina belongs to the Holcim Group and is a world leader in innovative and sustainable
solutions for construction. With more than 90 years of experience in Argentina, it employs more than
1,000 collaborators and has extensive coverage of the national territory. It has four cement plants
located in the provinces of Cérdoba, Mendoza, Jujuy and Buenos Aires. Likewise, it has permanent
and mobile plants of elaborated concrete: a plant of stone aggregates; and another for industrial
waste co-processing, called Geocycle.

At Holcim, we work for the cities of the future. The world population is estimated to reach 10 billion
by 2050, with 70% of people living in cities by then. With 1.6 billion people lacking adequate housing
and sanitation, we need to build livable cities that work for everyone. At Holcim, we are part of the
solution.

United in our vision to be the global leader in innovative and sustainable building solutions, we play
an essential role in accelerating our world's transition to a more inclusive, net-zero emissions future.
Driven by our purpose to create progress for people and the planet, we are at the forefront of
sustainable building solutions.

DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCT AND SCOPE

This EPD is prepared for products classified as UN CPC Group 3744-Cement or CSI MasterFormat
Division 03 30 00 Cast-in-Place Concrete.

This EPD is primary reported Holcim data from the reference year 2021. It reports on the ten cement
mixes produced at the Campana cement plant, made from primarily limestone. These ten cement
mixes make up 100% of yearly production at the Campana cement plant. Cement from the Campana
cement plant is used in the EPDs for concrete mixes in Argentina concrete plants. This is a grinding
facility only and does not house a kiln.

This LCA assumes the impacts from products manufactured in accordance with the standards
outlined in this report. This LCA is a cradle-to-gate study , and therefore, stages extending beyond
the plant gate are not included in this LCA. Excluded stages include transportation of the
manufactured material to the construction site; on-site construction processes and components:
building (infrastructure) use and maintenance: and “end-of-life” effects.

CEMENT DESIGN SUMMARY

The following tables provide a list of the cement products considered in this EPD along with key

For this LCA the manufacturing plant, owned and operated by Holcim Argentina, is located at their
Planta Campana facility in Argentina. All operating data is formulated using the actual data from
Holcim Argentina plant at the above location, including water, energy consumption and waste
generation. Al inputs for this system boundary are calculated for the plant.

This life cycle inventory Was organized in a spreadsheet and was then input into an RStudio
environment where pre-calculated LCIA results for relevant products/activities stemming from the
ecoinvent v3.8 database and a local EPD database in combination with primary data from Holcim
Argentina were utilized. Explanations of the contribution of each data source to this study are
outlined in the section ‘Data Sources and Quality”. Further LCI details for each declared product are
provided in the sections ‘Detailed LCI tables’ and ‘Transport tables’ of the detailed LCA report. A
parameter uncertainty analysis was also performed where key statistical results (e.g. min/mean/max
etc.) are provided in the detailed LCA report.

ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION

CUT-OFF CRITERIA

ISO 14044:2006 and the focus PCR requires the LCA model to contain a minimum of 95% of the total
inflows (mass and energy) to the upstream and core modules be included in this study. The cut-off
criteria were applied to all other processes unless otherwise noted above as follows. À 1% cut-off is
considered for all renewable and non-renewable primary energy consumption and the total mass of
inputs within a unit process where the total of the neglected inputs does not exceed 5%.

DATA SOURCES AND DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

Raw material transport: À combination of actual mode/distance combinations were assumed for
key bulk materials whereas ecoinvent default multi-modal market mix distances were assumed for
other inputs where no original data could be provided.

Electricity: Electrcity values entered Were from primary Holcim Argentina reporting for the reference
year 2021. The ecoinvent unit process “market for electricity, medium voltage/electricity, medium
voltage/AR/KWh" \was used.

Process/space heating: Natural gas is used for drying the clinker at this facility. Campana is a
grinding facility only. It does not have a kiln..

Fuel required for machinery: There is no additional fuel used for machinery at this plant.

Waste generation: Waste generation values are directly reported from Holcim operations for the
reference year 2021.

Recovered energy: Not Applicable.
Recycled/reused material/components: Not applicable.
Module A1 material Losses: Due to lack of data, default loss factors were assumedl.

Direct A3 emissions accounting: All emission data are based on primary fuel reporting from Holcim
Argentina. This is a grinding facility only therefore it does not have a kiln. Only natural gas in burned at
this location for which an ecoinvent unit process was used.

Waste transport requirements: Transportation distances are using estimated values. The waste
hauler cannot guarantee the exact distances traveled due to the variation of route and actual location
of disposal. Most hazardous waste disposal sites are near the plant therefore the 25 km distance is a
representative estimate.

The following tables depict a list of assumed life cycle inventory üutilized in the LCA modeling to
generate the impact results across the life cycle modules in scope. An assessment of the quality of
each LCI activities utilized from various sources is also provided.

DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

Data quality/variability requirements, as specified in the PCR, are applied. This section describes the
achieved data quality relative to the ISO 14044:2006 requirements. Data quality is judged based on its
precision (measured, calculated, or estimated), completeness (e.g. unreported emissions),
consistency (degree of uniformity of the methodology applied within a study serving as a data
source) and representativeness (geographical, temporal, and technological).

Precision: Through measurement and calculation, the manufacturers collected and provided primary
data on their annual production. For accuracy, the LCA practitioner and 3rd Party Verifier validated
the plant gate-to-gate data.

Completeness: Al relevant specific processes, including inputs (raw materials, energy, and ancillary
materials) and outputs (emissions and production volume) were considered and modeled to
represent the specified and declared products. Most relevant background materials and processes
were taken from ecoinvent v3.6 LCI datasets where relatively recent region-specific electricity inputs
were utilized. The most relevant EPDs requiring key A1 inputs were also utilized where readily
available.

Consistency: To ensure consistency, the same modeling structure across the respective product
systems was utilized for all inputs, which consisted of raw material inputs and ancillary material,
energy flows, water resource inputs, product, and co-products outputs, returned and recovered
Cement materials, emissions to air, water and soil, and waste recycling and treatment. The same
background LCI datasets from the ecoinvent v3.6 database were used across all product systems.
Crosschecks concerning the plausibility of mass and energy flows Wwere continuously conducted. The
LCA team conducted mass and energy balances at the plant and selected process level to maintain
a high level of consistency.

Reproducibility: Internal reproducibility is possible since the data and the models are stored and
available in a machine-readable project file for all foreground and background processes, and in
Eco-Purpose's proprietary Cement LCA calculator” for all production facility and product-specific
calculations. À considerable level of transparency is provided throughout the detailed LCA report as
the specifications and material quantity make-up for the declared products are presented and key
primary and secondary LCI data sources are summarized. The provision of more detailed publicly
accessible data to allow full external reproducibility was not possible due to reasons of
confidentiality.

Label Sustainability has developed a proprietary tool that allows the calculation of PCR-compliant
LCA results for Cement product designs. The tool auto-calculates results by scaling base-unit
Technosphere inputs (i.e. 1 kg sand, 1 KWh electricity, etc.) to replicate the reference flow
conversions that take place in any typical LCA software like openLCA or SimaPro. The tool was

LABELING SUSTAINABILITY | 10

ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION

tested against several LCAs performed in openLCA and the tool generated identical results to those
realized in openLCA across every impact category and inventory metric (where comparisons could
be readily made).

Representativeness: The representativeness of the data is summarized as follows.

e Time related coverage of the manufacturing processes’ primary collected data from
2020-01-01 to 2020-12-31.

e _ Upstream (background) LCI data was either the PCR specified default (if applicable) or
more appropriate LCI datasets as found in the country-adjusted ecoinvent v3.6 database.

e _Geographical coverage for inputs required by the A3 facility(ies) is representative of its
region of focus; other upstream and background processes are based on US, North
American, or global average data and adjusted to regional electricity mixes when
relevant.

e _Technological coverage is typical or average and specific to the participating facilities for
all primary data.

ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS AND INVENTORY METRICS

Per the PCR, this EPD supports the life cycle impact assessment indicators and inventory metrics as
listed in the tables below. As specified in the PCR, the most recent US EPA Tool for the Reduction
and Assessment of Chemical and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI), impact categories were
utilized as they provide a North American context for the mandatory category indicators to be
included in the EPD. Additionally, the PCR requires a set of inventory metrics to be reported with the
LCIA indicators.

It should be noted that emerging LCA impact categories and inventory items are still under
development and can have high levels of uncertainty that preclude international acceptance
pending further development. Use caution when interpreting data in any of the following categories.

LIMITATIONS

This EPD is a declaration of potential environmental impact and does not support or provide
definitive comparisons of the environmental performance of specific products. Only EPDS prepared
from cradle-to-grave life cycle results and based on the same function and reference service life and
quantified by the same functional unit can be used to assist purchasers and users in making informed
comparisons between products.

LCIA results are relative expressions and do not predict impacts on category endpoints, the
exceeding of thresholds, safety margins or risks. Further, LCA offers a wide array of environmental
impact indicators, and this EPD reports a collection of those, as specified by the PCR.

In addition to the impact results, this EPD provides several metrics related to resource consumption
and waste generation. While these data may be informational in other ways, they do not provide a
measure of impact on the environment.
