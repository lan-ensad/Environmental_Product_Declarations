COMPANY DESCRIPTION

Holcim Argentina belongs to the Holcim Group and is a world leader in innovative and sustainable
solutions for construction. With more than 90 years of experience in Argentina, it employs more than
1,000 collaborators and has extensive coverage of the national territory. It has four cement plants
located in the provinces of Cérdoba, Mendoza, Jujuy and Buenos Aires. Likewise, it has permanent
and mobile plants of elaborated concrete: a plant of stone aggregates; and another for industrial
waste co-processing, called Geocycle.

At Holcim, we work for the cities of the future. The world population is estimated to reach 10 billion
by 2050, with 70% of people living in cities by then. With 1.6 billion people lacking adequate housing
and sanitation, we need to build livable cities that work for everyone. At Holcim, we are part of the
solution.

United in our vision to be the global leader in innovative and sustainable building solutions, we play
an essential role in accelerating our world's transition to a more inclusive, net-zero emissions future.
Driven by our purpose to create progress for people and the planet, we are at the forefront of
sustainable building solutions.

STUDY GOAL

The intended application of this life cycle assessment (LCA) is to comply with the procedures for
creating a Type Ill environmental product declaration (EPD) and publish the EPD for public review on
the website, http://labelingsustainability.com/ . This level of study is in accordance with EPD
Product Category Rule (PCR) for Ready Mix Concrete published by NSF International (2019) and is a
sub-PCR of International Standards Organization (ISO) 21930:2017 Sustainability in buildings and civil
works - Core rules for EPDs of construction products and services; International Standards
Organization (ISO) 14025:2006 Environmental labels and declarations, Type Ill environmental
declarations-Principles and procedures; ISO 14044:2006 Environmental management, Life cycle
assessment- Requirements and guidelines; and ISO 14040:2006 Environmental management, Life
cycle assessment-Principles and framework. The performance of this study and its subsequent
publishing is in alignment with the business-to-business (B2B) communication requirements for the
environmental assessment of building products. The study does not intend to support comparative
assertions and is intended to be disclosed to the public.

This project report was commissioned to differentiate Holcim Argentina from their competition for
the following reasons: generate an advantage for the organization: offer customers information to
help them make informed product decisions; improve the environmental performance of Holcim
Argentina by continuously measuring, controlling and reducing the environmental impacts of their
products; help project facilitators working on Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)
projects achieve their credit goal: and to strengthen Holcim Argentina's license to operate in the
community. The intended audience for this LCA report is Holcim Argentina's employees, their
suppliers, project specifiers of their products, architects, and engineers. The EPD report is also
available for policy makers, government officials interested in sustainability, academic professors,
and LCA professionals. This LCA report does not include product comparisons from other facilities.

DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCT AND SCOPE

This EPD reports on 3 concrete mixes manufactured at the Holcim Argentina KHP9-Tunel de
Caracoles concrete facility in Mendoza, Argentina.

This LCA assumes the impacts from products manufactured in accordance with the standards
ouütlined in this report. This LCA is a cradle-to-gate study and therefore, stages extending beyond the
plant gate are not included in this LCA. Excluded stages include transportation of the manufactured
material to the construction site: on-site construction processes and components; building
(infrastructure) use and maintenance: and “end-of-life” effects.

ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION

e Production, manufacture, and construction of A3 building/capital goods and
infrastructure.

e Production and manufacture of steel production equipment, steel delivery vehicles,
earth-moving equipment, and laboratory equipment.

e Personnel-related activities (travel, furniture, office supplies).

e Energy use related to company management and sales activities.

For this LCA the manufacturing plant, owned and operated by Holcim Argentina, is located at their
KHP9 facility in Argentina. Al operating data is formulated using the actual data from Holcim
Argentina's plant at the above location, including water, energy consumption and waste generation.
Al inputs for this system boundary are calculated for the plant.

This life cycle inventory Was organized in a spreadsheet and was then input into an RStudio
environment where pre-calculated LCIA results for relevant products/activities stemming from the
ecoinvent v3.8 database and a local EPD database in combination with primary data from Holcim
Argentina were utilized. Explanations of the contribution of each data source to this study are
outlined in the section ‘Data Sources and Quality’. Further LCI details for each declared product are
provided in the sections ‘Detailed LCI tables’ and ‘Transport tables’ of the detailed LCA report. A
parameter uncertainty analysis was also performed where key statistical results (e.g. min/mean/max
etc.) are provided in the detailed LCA report.

CUT-OFF CRITERIA

ISO 14044:2006 and the focus PCR requires the LCA model to contain a minimum of 95% of the total
inflows (mass and energy) to the upstream and core modules be included in this study. The cut-off
criteria were applied to all other processes unless otherwise noted above as follows. À 1% cut-off is
considered for all renewable and non-renewable primary energy consumption and the total mass of
inputs within a unit process where the total of the neglected inputs does not exceed 5%.

DATA SOURCES AND DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

Raw material transport: À combination of actual mode/distance combinations were assumed for
key bulk materials whereas ecoinvent default multi-modal market mix distances were assumed for
other inputs where no original data could be provided.

Electricity: This plant did not use electricity in 2021 per primary Holcim records.

Process/space heating: No fuel is used for space Heating at this plant.

Fuel required for machinery: Machinery-related fuel requirements were determined from direct
Holcim information. The types of machinery used include generators, pumps to pump concrete to
higher elevations, and transportation equipment used for moving materials. This plant does not have
electricity therefore it uses diesel to power generators.

Waste generation: Waste generation values are directly reported from Holcim operations for bulk
waste. No hazardous or high-level radioactive waste is generated on-site at this facility. Wash water
for trucks Was also primary reported data for 2021.

LABELING SUSTAINABILITY | 6 @

ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION

Recovered energy: Not applicable.

Recycled/reused material/components: The amount of returned concrete is based on Holcim
primary data for the reference year, 2021.

Module A1 material Losses: Due to lack of data, default loss factors Were assumedl.

Direct A3 emissions accounting: Direct emissions for the on-site machinery use the actual fuel
consumption and the ecoinvent database to calculate those emissions.

Waste transport requirements: Transportation distances are using estimated values. The waste
hauler cannot guarantee the exact distances traveled due to the variation of route and actual location
of disposal. Most waste disposal sites are near the plant therefore the 25 km distance is a
representative estimate. Returned concrete and Wash water, measured in kilograms, is based on
direct Holcim reporting for the reference year 2021.

Product transport requirements: The diesel fuel used by the mixing trucks is direct primary
information reported from Holcim Argentina records for the year 2021. Holcim records their fuel for
their trucks in /km and therefore the information was converted with the following formula: (Ave. km
to site)’ 2 for return L diesel/km / (ave. m3 of concrete in a load) total concrete volume in m3 ‘
fraction allocated to A3. A4 is outside the scope of this study.

The following tables depict a list of assumed life cycle inventory üutilized in the LCA modeling to
generate the impact results across the life cycle modules in scope. An assessment of the quality of
each LCI activities utilized from various sources is also provided.

DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

Data quality/variability requirements, as specified in the PCR, are applied. This section describes the
achieved data quality relative to the ISO 14044:2006 requirements. Data quality is judged based on its
precision (measured, calculated, or estimated), completeness (e.g. unreported emissions),
consistency (degree of uniformity of the methodology applied within a study serving as a data
source) and representativeness (geographical, temporal, and technological).

Precision: Through measurement and calculation, the manufacturers collected and provided primary
data on their annual production. For accuracy, the LCA practitioner and 3rd Party Verifier validated
the plant gate-to-gate data.

Completeness: All relevant specific processes, including inputs (raw materials, energy, and ancillary
materials) and outputs (emissions and production volume) were considered and modeled to
represent the specified and declared products. The majority of relevant background materials and
processes were taken from ecoinvent v3.8 LCI datasets where relatively recent region-specific
electricity inputs were utilized. The most relevant EPDs requiring key A1 inputs were also utilized
where readily available.

Consistency: To ensure consistency, the same modeling structure across the respective product
systems was utilized for all inputs, which consisted of raw material inputs and ancillary material,
energy flows, water resource inputs, product, and co-products outputs, returned and recovered
Cement materials, emissions to air, water and soil, and waste recycling and treatment. The same
background LCI datasets from the ecoinvent v3.8 database were used across all product systems.
Crosschecks concerning the plausibility of mass and energy flows Wwere continuously conducted. The
LCA team conducted mass and energy balances at the plant and selected process level to maintain
a high level of consistency.

Reproducibility: Internal reproducibility is possible since the data and the models are stored and
available in a machine readable project file for all foreground and background processes, and in
Labeling Sustainability's proprietary Ready Mix Concrete LCA calculator’ for all production facility
and product-specific calculations. À considerable level of transparency is provided throughout the
detailed LCA report as the specifications and material quantity make-up for the declared products
are presented and key primary and secondary LCI data sources are summarized. The provision of
more detailed publicly accessible data to allow full external reproducibility was not possible due to

reasons of confidentiality.

‘Labeling Sustainability has developed a proprietary tool that allows the calculation of PCR-
compliant LCA results for Ready Mix Concrete product designs. The tool auto-calculates results by
scaling base-unit technosphere inputs (ie. 1 kg sand, 1 KWh electricity, etc.) to replicate the reference

ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION

flow conversions that take place in any typical LCA software like openLCA or SimaPro. The tool was
tested against several LCASs performed in openLCA and the tool generated identical results to those
realized in openLCA across every impact category and inventory metric (where comparisons could
be readily made).

Representativeness: The representativeness of the data is summarized as follows.

e Time related coverage of the manufacturing processes’ primary collected data from
2021-01-01 to 2021-12-31.

e _ Upstream (background) LCI data was either the PCR specified default (if applicable) or
more appropriate LCI datasets as found in the country-adjusted ecoinvent v3.8 database.

e _Geographical coverage for inputs required by the A3 facility(ies) is representative of its
region of focus; other upstream and background processes are based on US, North
American, or global average data and adjusted to regional electricity mixes when
relevant.

e Technological coverage is typical or average and specific to the participating facilities for
all primary data.

ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS AND INVENTORY METRICS —

Per the PCR, this EPD supports the life cycle impact assessment indicators and inventory metrics as
listed in the tables below. As specified in the PCR, the most recent US EPA Tool for the Reduction
and Assessment of Chemical and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI), impact categories were
utilized as they provide a North American context for the mandatory category indicators to be
included in the EPD. Additionally, the PCR requires a set of inventory metrics to be reported with the
LCIA indicators (see tables below).

It should be noted that emerging LCA impact categories and inventory items are still under
development and can have high levels of uncertainty that preclude international acceptance
pending further development. Use caution when interpreting data in any of the following categories.

TOTAL IMPACT SUMMARY

The following table reports the total LCA results for each product produced at the given cement
facility on a per 1m3 of concrete basis.
