COMPANY DESCRIPTION

Holcim (Nicaragua) S.A. was born in 1997 as a result of the union of a group of distinguished
Nicaraguan investors and Holcim Ltd. The Company is part of the Holcim Group, formerly the Lafarge
Holcim Group created in July 2015, as a result of the merger of Holcim and Lafarge.

Two Companies with more than 180 years of combined experience, the unified group has now
ushered in a new era of cutting-edge technology and innovation in the building materials industry,
focused to meet the challenges of the 21st century. As the company becomes a world leader in
innovative and sustainable building solutions, the Global Board of Directors recommended
simplifying the Group's name to achieve greater impact and efficiency while building its Legacy. Our
shareholders voted unanimously in favor of the proposed Group name change from LafargeHolcim
Ltd to Holcim Ltd on May 4, 2021. Holcim Group launched a new corporate identity on July 8, 2021
and in Latin America it was implemented as of May 1. July 2022. Holcim operates under that name in
70 countries around the world, with a team of more than 70,000 partners worldwide - Builders of
Progress with more than 2,300 Work Centers around the world.

Currently, Holcim (Nicaragua) S.A. with a cement production capacity of more than 400 million tons
per year, it occupies a preferential place among consumers, an achievement obtained from product
quality, technical support and excellence in customer service.

In 2006, the Cement Plant, located in Nagarote, was certified by INCOTEC under the International
Standard Organization (ISO) in ISO 9001 (Quality); ISO 14001 (Environment). Additionally, it has been
recognized, once a year, as a Leading Company in Health and Safety, an award granted by the
National Council of Occupational Hygiene and Safety; and for five consecutive years it has received
the National Quality Award from the Ministry of Development, Industry and Commerce, MIFIC.

In 2008, Holcim (Nicaragua) S.A entered the ready-mix concrete business, demonstrating once again
its trust in Nicaragua and its people. This Plant, for its part, has received the Leading Company in
Occupational Hygiene, Health and Safety award three times.

In 2009, the Company founded the Construmäs Hardware Franchise network, with the purpose of
strengthening its distribution channel and providing a better value offer, both toits distributor clients
and to end users. This network evolved and in 2018 it became Disensa, the largest hardware store
network in Latin America, they are the retail service stores of the LafargeHolcim group.

Disensa is currently the largest hardware store network in the country, demonstrating value to the
owners of more than 70 points of sale and their customers with a presence in 15 departments in
Nicaragua. Disensa meets the significant growth in demand in the Nicaraguan market, with advice on
construction and an innovative value offer that accompanies the franchise.

STUDY GOAL

The intended application of this life cycle assessment (LCA) is to comply with the procedures for
creating a Type Ill environmental product declaration (EPD) and publish the EPD for public review on
the website, http://labelingsustainability.com/ . This level of study is in accordance with EPD
Product Category Rule (PCR) for Cement published by NSF (2020) and is a PCR in accordance with
ISO 21930 for Preparing an Environmental Product Declaration for Portland, Blended Hydraulic,
Masonry, Mortar, and Plastic (Stucco) Cements. EPDs for cements that follow other PCRs may not be

performance of this study and its subsequent publishing is in alignment with the business-to-
business (B2B) communication requirements for the environmental assessment of building products.
The study does not intend to support comparative assertions and is intended to be disclosed to the
public.

This project report was commissioned to differentiate Holcim Nicaragua from their competition for
the following reasons: generate an advantage for the organization: offer customers information to
help them make informed product decisions; improve the environmental performance of Holcim
Nicaragua by continuously measuring, controlling and reducing the environmental impacts of their
products; help project facilitators working on Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)
projects achieve their credit goal; and to strengthen Holcim Nicaragua's license to operate in the
community. The intended audience for this LCA report is Holcim Nicaragua's employees, their
suppliers, project specifiers of their products, architects, and engineers. The EPD report is also
available for policy makers, government officials interested in sustainability, academic professors,
and LCA professionals. This LCA report does not include product comparisons from other facilities.
Only EPDSs prepared from cradle-to-grave life-cycle results and based on the same function,
reference service life, and quantified by the same functional unit, can be used to assist purchasers
and users in making informed comparisons between products. Since EPDs developed under these
PCR only cover the cradle-to-gate impacts of portland, blended hydraulic, masonry, mortar, or
plastic (stucco) cements, using a declared unit, the results cannot be used to compare products used
in different mixtures and construction products. The results from a portland, blended hydraulic,
masonry, mortar, or plastic (stucco) cements EPD must be integrated into a comprehensive cradle-
to-grave, ISO 14044-compliant LCA in order to compare between different products. The basis of a
comparison, where applicable, shall include the product application in accordance \Wwith ISO 21930
ASTM (2014).

DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCT AND SCOPE

This EPD is prepared for products classified as UN CPC Group 3744-Cement or CSI MasterFormat
Division 03 30 00 Cast-in-Place Concrete

This EPD is primary reported Holcim data from the reference year 2021. It reports on the three
cement mixes produced at the Nagarote grinding plant, made from primarily clinker, natural gypsum
and pozzolana. Clinker is transported from six different cement plant: Holcim Costa Rica (CR), Holcim
EL Salvador (ES), CEMEX Nicaragua (NC), Holcim Mexico (MX), Holcim Ecuador (EC) and imported
clinker from Japan. The imported clinker is used for the cement reported in this EPD. This plant is a
grinding operation and does not operate a kiln.

This LCA assumes the impacts from products manufactured in accordance with the standards
outlined in this report. This LCA is a cradle-to-gate study, and therefore, stages extending beyond the
plant gate are not included in this LCA. Excluded stages include transportation of the manufactured
material to the construction site: on-site construction processes and components; building
(infrastructure) use and maintenance: and “end-of-life” effects.

For this LCA the manufacturing plant, owned and operated by Holcim Nicaragua, is located at their
Nagarote facility in Nicaragua. Al operating data is formulated using the actual data from Holcim
Nicaragua's plant at the above location, including water, energy consumption and waste generation.
Al inputs for this system boundary are calculated for the plant.

This life cycle inventory Was organized in a spreadsheet and was then input into an RStudio
environment where pre-calculated LCIA results for relevant products/activities stemming from the
ecoinvent v3.8 database and a local EPD database in combination with primary data from Holcim
Nicaragua were utilized. Explanations of the contribution of each data source to this study are
outlined in the section ‘Data Sources and Quality’. Further LCI details for each declared product are
provided in the sections ‘Detailed LCI tables’ and ‘Transport tables’ of the detailed LCA report. A
parameter uncertainty analysis was also performed where key statistical results (e.g. min/mean/max
etc.) are provided in the detailed LCA report.

CUT-OFF CRITERIA

ISO 14044:2006 and the focus PCR requires the LCA model to contain a minimum of 95% of the total
inflows (mass and energy) to the upstream and core modules be included in this study. The cut-off
criteria were applied to all other processes unless otherwise noted above as follows. À 1% cut-off is
considered for all renewable and non-renewable primary energy consumption and the total mass of
inputs within a unit process where the total of the neglected inputs does not exceed 5%.

DATA SOURCES AND DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

Raw material transport: À combination of actual mode/distance combinations were assumed for
key bulk materials whereas ecoinvent default multi-modal market mix distances were assumed for
other inputs where no original data could be provided.

Electricity: Electricity consumption values are for Holcim Nicaragua in calendar year 2021. These
values were direct reported from Holcim Nicaragua records. The unit process “market for electricity,
medium voltage/electricity, medium voltage/NI/KWh" was used to represent the Nicaragua grid
electricity used by the Nagarote plant.

Process/space heating: Al process and space heating values were determined from Holcim
Nicaragua reporting. Ecoinvent 3.8 unit processes were used to convert recoded fuel usage into
amount burned in MJ. The conversion factor 1 kg of oil- 41.868 MJ was used for the heavy fuel oil.

Fuel required for machinery: Machinery-related fuel requirements were determined from direct
Holcim information for propane use outside the kiln. Propane is used for moving vehicles for raw
materials. Direct emission calculations for propane were calculated with ecoinvent 3.8 unit processes
normalized to the amount of fuel used per ton of cement.

Waste generation: Waste generation values are directly reported from Holcim operations for both
bulk waste and hazardous waste. No High-level radioactive waste is generated on-site at this facility

Recovered energy: Not applicable
Recycled/reused material/components: Not applicable.
Module A1 material Losses: Due to lack of data, default loss factors were assumedl.

Direct A3 emissions accounting: This plant is a grinding plant and does not have a kiln; therefore, the
direct emissions are for moving vehicles and dryers for the pozzolana. All direct emissions data were
calculated from Holcim Nicaragua's direct reporting of fuel usage and Ecoinvent default processes
for burning those fuels. Holcim Nicaragua does not directly report its emissions.

Waste transport requirements: Transportation distances are using estimated values. The waste
hauler cannot guarantee the exact distances traveled due to the variation of route and actual location
of disposal. Most hazardous waste disposal sites are near the plant therefore the 25 km distance is a
representative estimate.

The following tables depict a list of assumed life cycle inventory üutilized in the LCA modeling to
generate the impact results across the life cycle modules in scope. An assessment of the quality of
each LCI activities utilized from various sources is also providedl.

Data quality/variability requirements, as specified in the PCR, are applied. This section describes the
achieved data quality relative to the ISO 14044:2006 requirements. Data quality is judged based on its

ENVIRONMENTAL FPRODUCT DECLARATIONM

precision (measured, calculated, or estimated), completeness (e.g. unreported emissions),
consistency (degree of uniformity of the methodology applied within a study serving as a data
source) and representativeness (geographical, temporal, and technological).

Precision: Through measurement and calculation, the manufacturers collected and provided primary
data on their annual production. For accuracy, the LCA practitioner and 3rd Party Verifier validated
the plant gate-to-gate data.

Completeness: Al relevant specific processes, including inputs (raw materials, energy, and ancillary
materials) and outputs (emissions and production volume) were considered and modeled to
represent the specified and declared products. Most relevant background materials and processes
were taken from ecoinvent Vv3.6 LCI datasets where relatively recent region-specific electricity inputs
were utilized. The most relevant EPDs requiring key A1 inputs were also utilized where readily
available.

Consistency: To ensure consistency, the same modeling structure across the respective product
systems was utilized for all inputs, which consisted of raw material inputs and ancillary material,
energy flows, water resource inputs, product, and co-products outputs, returned and recovered
Cement materials, emissions to air, water and soil, and waste recycling and treatment. The same
background LCI datasets from the ecoinvent v3.6 database were used across all product systems.
Crosschecks concerning the plausibility of mass and energy flows Were continuously conducted. The
LCA team conducted mass and energy balances at the plant and selected process level to maintain
a high level of consistency.

Reproducibility: Internal reproducibility is possible since the data and the models are stored and
available in a machine-readable project file for all foreground and background processes, and in
Eco-Purpose's proprietary Cement LCA calculator” for all production facility and product-specific
calculations. À considerable level of transparency is provided throughout the detailed LCA report as
the specifications and material quantity make-up for the declared products are presented and key
primary and secondary LCI data sources are summarized. The provision of more detailed publicly
accessible data to allow full external reproducibility was not possible due to reasons of
confidentiality.

Label Sustainability has developed a proprietary tool that allows the calculation of PCR-compliant
LCA results for Cement product designs. The tool auto-calculates results by scaling base-unit
Technosphere inputs (i.e. 1 kg sand, 1 KWh electricity, etc.) to replicate the reference flow
conversions that take place in any typical LCA software like openLCA or SimaPro. The tool was
tested against several LCAs performed in openLCA and the tool generated identical results to those
realized in openLCA across every impact category and inventory metric (where comparisons could
be readily made).

Representativeness: The representativeness of the data is summarized as follows.

e Time related coverage of the manufacturing processes’ primary collected data from
2020-01-01 to 2020-12-31.

e _ Upstream (background) LCI data was either the PCR specified default (if applicable) or
more appropriate LCI datasets as found in the country-adjusted ecoinvent v3.6 database.

e _Geographical coverage for inputs required by the A3 facility(ies) is representative of its
region of focus; other upstream and background processes are based on US, North
American, or global average data and adjusted to regional electricity mixes when
relevant.

ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS AND INVENTORY METRICS

Per the PCR, this EPD supports the life cycle impact assessment indicators and inventory metrics as
listed in the tables below. As specified in the PCR, the most recent US EPA Tool for the Reduction
and Assessment of Chemical and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI), impact categories were
utilized as they provide a North American context for the mandatory category indicators to be
included in the EPD. Additionally, the PCR requires a set of inventory metrics to be reported with the
LCIA indicators (see tables below).

It should be noted that emerging LCA impact categories and inventory items are still under
development and can have high levels of uncertainty that preclude international acceptance
pending further development. Use caution when interpreting data in any of the following categories.

LIMITATIONS

This EPD is a declaration of potential environmental impact and does not support or provide
definitive comparisons of the environmental performance of specific products. Only EPDS prepared
from cradle-to-grave life cycle results and based on the same function and reference service life and
quantified by the same functional unit can be used to assist purchasers and users in making informed
comparisons between products.

LCIA results are relative expressions and do not predict impacts on category endpoints, the
exceeding of thresholds, safety margins or risks. Further, LCA offers a wide array of environmental
impact indicators, and this EPD reports a collection of those, as specified by the PCR.

In addition to the impact results, this EPD provides several metrics related to resource consumption
and waste generation. While these data may be informational in other ways, they do not provide a
measure of impact on the environment.

TOTAL IMPACT SUMMARY

The following table reports the total LCA results for each product produced at the given cement
facility on a per 1 tonne of cement basis.
