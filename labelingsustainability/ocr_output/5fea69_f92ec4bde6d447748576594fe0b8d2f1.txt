COMPANY DESCRIPTION

Holcim (Nicaragua) SA was born in 1997 as a result of the union of a group of distinguished Nicaraguan
investors and Holcim Ltd. The Company is part of the Holcim Group, formerly the LafargeHolcim
Group, created in July 2015, as a result of the merger of Holcim and Lafarge.

Holcim Nicaragua is a member of the international group of the same name, leader in the construction
materials industry, operating in Nicaragua for 23 years, producing cement, concrete, aggregates and
solutions for the construction market. The company offer different types of cement solutions with
special qualities: Holcim Fuerte EcoPlanet, Holcim Industrial and Holcim Superbloque, our leading
Fuerte EcoPlanet cement has ECO Labels that guarantee a cement with 35% less CO2 emissions per
ton.

Currently, Holcim (Nicaragua) SA, with a cement production capacity of more than 400,000 tons per
year, occupies a preferential place among consumers, an achievement obtained from product quality,
technical support and excellence in customer service. The company has a cement grinding plant in
Nagarote, a fixed concrete plant in Managua, mobile concrete equipment in Chinandega, and an
aggregates plant in Cofradia. It has Disensa, the largest hardware network in the country, generating
value for the owners of more than 78 points of sale and their clients with a presence in 14 departments
and two autonomous regions of Nicaragua.

STUDY GOAL

The intended application of this life cycle assessment (LCA) is to comply with the procedures for
creating a Type Ill environmental product declaration (EPD) and publish the EPD for public review on
the website, http://labelingsustainability.com/ . This level of study is in accordance with EPD Product
Category Rule (PCR) for Ready Mix Concrete published by NSF International (2019) and is a sub-PCR
of International Standards Organization (ISO) 21930:2017 Sustainability in buildings and civil works -
Core rules for EPDs of construction products and services; International Standards Organization (ISO)
14025:2006 Environmental labels and declarations, Type Ill environmental declarations-Principles and
procedures; ISO 14044:2006 Environmental management, Life cycle assessment- Requirements and
guidelines; and ISO 14040:2006 Environmental management, Life cycle assessment-Principles and
framework. The performance of this study and its subsequent publishing is in alignment with the
business-to-business (B2B) communication requirements for the environmental assessment of
building products. The study does not intend to support comparative assertions and is intended to be
disclosed to the public.

This project report \was commissioned to differentiate Holcim Nicaragua from their competition for the
following reasons: generate an advantage for the organization: offer customers information to help
them make informed product decisions; improve the environmental performance of Holcim Nicaragua
by continuously measuring, controlling and reducing the environmental impacts of their products; help
project facilitators working on Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) projects achieve
their credit goal; and to strengthen Holcim Nicaragua's license to operate in the community. The
intended audience for this LCA report is Holcim Nicaragua's employees, their suppliers, project
specifiers of their products, architects, and engineers. The EPD report is also available for policy
makers, government officials interested in sustainability, academic professors, and LCA professionals.
This LCA report does not include product comparisons from other facilities.

DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCT AND SCOPE

This EPD reports on 61 concrete mixes manufactured at the KM15 Holcim Nicaragua concrete facility
in Chinandega, Nicaragua.

This LCA assumes the impacts from products manufactured in accordance with the standards outlined
in this report. This LCA is a cradle-to-gate study, and therefore, stages extending beyond the plant
gate are not included in this LCA. Excluded stages include transportation of the manufactured material
to the construction site: on-site construction processes and components; building (infrastructure) use
and maintenance: and “end-of-life” effects.

Figure 1: General Life cycle phases for consideration in a construction works system

This is a Cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment and the following life cycle stages are included in the
study:

e A1: Raw material supply (upstream processes) - Extraction, handling, and processing of the
materials used in manufacturing the declared products in this LCA.

e A2: Transportation - Transportation of A1 materials from the supplier to the “gate” of the
manufacturing facility (i.e. A3).

e A3: Manufacturing (core processes)- The energy and other utility inputs used to store,
move, and manufacturer the declared products and to operate the facility.

As according to the PCR, the following figure illustrates the general activities and input requirements
for producing cement products and is not necessarily exhaustive.

In addition, as according to the relevant PCR, the following requirements are excluded from this study:

e Production, manufacture, and construction of A3 building/capital goods and infrastructure.

e Production and manufacture of steel production equipment, steel delivery vehicles, earth-
moving equipment, and laboratory equipment.

e Personnel-related activities (travel, furniture, office supplies).

e Energy use related to company management and sales activities.

For this LCA the manufacturing plant, owned and operated by Holcim Nicaragua, is located at their
KM15 facility in Nicaragua. All operating data is formulated using the actual data from Holcim
Nicaragua's plant at the above location, including water, energy consumption and waste generation.
Al inputs for this system boundary are calculated for the plant.

This life cycle inventory Was organized in a spreadsheet and Was then input into an RStudio
environment where pre-calculated LCIA results for relevant products/activities stemming from the
ecoinvent v3.8 database and a local EPD database in combination with primary data from Holcim
Nicaragua were utilized. Explanations of the contribution of each data source to this study are outlined
in the section ‘Data Sources and Quality’. Further LCI details for each declared product are provided in
the sections ‘Detailed LCI tables’ and ‘Transport tables’ of the detailed LCA report. À parameter

uncertainty analysis was also performed where key statistical results (e.g. min/mean/max etc.) are
provided in the detailed LCA report.

CUT-OFF CRITERIA

ISO 14044:2006 and the focus PCR requires the LCA model to contain a minimum of 95% of the total
inflows (mass and energy) to the upstream and core modules be included in this study. The cut-off
criteria were applied to all other processes unless otherwise noted above as follows. À 1% cut-off is
considered for all renewable and non-renewable primary energy consumption and the total mass of
inputs within a unit process where the total of the neglected inputs does not exceed 5%.

DATA SOURCES AND DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

The following table summarizes the facility's (i.e. A3) electricity consumption and on-site generation or
off-site contractual procurement (if applicable), process/space heating requirements, fuel inputs for
on-site machinery, and waste generation.

The following statements explain how the above facility requirements/generation were derived':
Raw material transport: A combination of actual mode/distance combinations were assumed for key
bulk materials whereas ecoinvent default multi-modal market mix distances were assumed for other

inputs where no original data could be provided.

Electricity: No grid electricity is consumed at this plant. À diesel powered generator is deployed at site
to meet the electricity requirements of the plant.

Process/space heating: No fuel is used for space Heating at this plant.

Fuel required for machinery: Machinery-related fuel requirements \Wwere determined from direct
Holcim information. The types of machinery used include generators, pumps to pump concrete to
higher elevations, and transportation equipment used for moving materials. This plant does not have
electricity therefore it uses diesel to power generators.

Waste generation: Waste generation values are directly reported from Holcim operations for bulk
waste. No hazardous or high-level radioactive waste is generated on-site at this facility. Wash water
for trucks Was also primary reported data for 2022.

Recovered energy: Not applicable.

Recycled/reused material/components: The amount of returned concrete is based on Holcim
primary data for the reference year, 2022.

Module A1 material Losses: Due to lack of data, default loss factors of 5% were assumed. The PCR
states" A3 shall include an assumption of 5% material loss unless product specific data is available and
transparently reported in the project LCA report underlying the EPD;"

Direct A3 emissions accounting: Direct emissions for the on-site machinery use the actual fuel
consumption and the ecoinvent database to calculate those emissions.

Waste transport requirements: Transportation distances are using estimated values. The waste hauler
cannot guarantee the exact distances traveled due to the variation of route and actual location of
disposal. Most waste disposal sites are near the plant therefore the 25 km distance is a representative
estimate. Returned concrete and Wash water, measured in kilograms, is based on direct Holcim
reporting for the reference year 2022.

Product transport requirements: The diesel fuel used by the mixing trucks is direct primary
information reported from Holcim Nicaragua records for the year 2022. Holcim records their fuel for
their trucks in L/km and therefore the information was converted with the following formula: (Ave. km
to site)’ 2 for return L diesel/km / (ave. m3 of concrete in a load) total concrete volume in m3 * fraction
allocated to A3. A4 is outside the scope of this study.

DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

Data quality/variability requirements, as specified in the PCR, are applied. This section describes the
achieved data quality relative to the ISO 14044:2006 requirements. Data quality is judged based on its
precision (measured, calculated, or estimated), completeness (eg. unreported emissions), consistency
(degree of uniformity of the methodology applied within a study serving as a data source) and
representativeness (geographical, temporal, and technological).

Precision: Through measurement and calculation, the manufacturers collected and provided primary
data on their annual production. For accuracy, the LCA practitioner and 3rd Party Verifier validated the
plant gate-to-gate data.

Completeness: All relevant specific processes, including inputs (raw materials, energy, and ancillary
materials) and outputs (emissions and production volume) were considered and modeled to represent
the specified and declared products. The majority of relevant background materials and processes
were taken from ecoinvent v3.8 LCI datasets where relatively recent region-specific electricity inputs
were utilized. The most relevant EPDs requiring key A1 inputs were also utilized where readily available.

Consistency: To ensure consistency, the same modeling structure across the respective product
systems was ütilized for allinputs, which consisted of raw material inputs and ancillary material, energy
flows, water resource inputs, product, and co-products outputs, returned and recovered Cement
materials, emissions to air, Water and soil, and waste recycling and treatment. The same background
LCI datasets from the ecoinvent v3.8 database were used across all product systems. Crosschecks
concerning the plausibility of mass and energy flows were continuously conducted. The LCA team
conducted mass and energy balances at the plant and selected process level to maintain a high level
of consistency.

Reproducibility: Internal reproducibility is possible since the data and the models are stored and
available in a machine readable project file for all foreground and background processes, and in
Labeling Sustainability's proprietary Ready Mix Concrete LCA calculator” for all production facility and
product-specific calculations. À considerable level of transparency is provided throughout the detailed
LCA report as the specifications and material quantity make-up for the declared products are
presented and key primary and secondary LCI data sources are summarized. The provision of more

ô LABELING SUSTAINABILITY 13 Hu HOLCIM
ENVIRONMENTAL FPRODUCT DECLARATIONM

detailed publicly accessible data to allow full external reproducibility was not possible due to reasons
of confidentiality.

‘Labeling Sustainability has developed a proprietary tool that allows the calculation of PCR-compliant
LCA results for Ready Mix Concrete product designs. The tool auto-calculates results by scaling base-
unit technosphere inputs (i.e.1 kg sand, 1 KWh electricity, etc.) to replicate the reference flow
conversions that take place in any typical LCA software like openLCA or SimaPro. The tool was tested
against several LCAs performed in openLCA and the tool generated identical results to those realized
in openLCA across every impact category and inventory metric (where comparisons could be readily
made).

Representativeness: The representativeness of the data is summarized as follows.

e Time related coverage of the manufacturing processes’ primary collected data from 2022-
01-01 to 2022-12-31.

e _Upstream (background) LCI data was either the PCR specified default (if applicable) or
more appropriate LCI datasets as found in the country-adjusted ecoinvent v3.8 database.

e _Geographical coverage for inputs required by the A3 facility(ies) is representative of its
region of focus; other upstream and background processes are based on US, North
American, or global average data and adjusted to regional electricity mixes when relevant.

e _Technological coverage is typical or average and specific to the participating facilities for
all primary data.

ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS AND INVENTORY METRICS

Per the PCR, this EPD supports the life cycle impact assessment indicators and inventory metrics as
listed in the tables below. As specified in the PCR, the most recent US EPA Tool for the Reduction
and Assessment of Chemical and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI), impact categories were
utilized as they provide a North American context for the mandatory category indicators to be
included in the EPD. Additionally, the PCR requires a set of inventory metrics to be reported with the
LCIA indicators (see tables below).

Midpoint impact categories

Global Warming Potential or climate change can be defined as the change
in global temperature caused by the greenhouse effect that the release of
greenhouse gases by human activity creates. The Environmental Profiles
Global Warming Potential characterization model is based on factors developed by the United
(GWP) (units: kg CO2-eq) Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Factors are
expressed as Global Warming Potential over the time horizon of different
years, being the most common 100 years (GWP100), measured in the
reference unit, kg CO2 equivalent.

Ozone-depleting gases cause damage to stratospheric ozone or the ozone
layer. CFCSs, halons and HCFCSs are the major causes of ozone depletion.
Ozone Depletion Potential The characterization model has been developed by the World

(ODP) (kg CFC-11-eq) Meteorological Organization (WMO) and defines the ozone depletion
potential of different gases relative to the reference substance
chlorofluorocarbon-11 (CFC-11), expressed in kg CFC-11 equivalent.

Acidic gases such as Sulphur dioxide (602) react with water in the
atmosphere to form acid rain, a process known as acid deposition.
Acidification potential is expressed using the reference unit, kg SO2
equivalent. The model does not take account of regional differences in
Acidification Potential (AP) terms of which areas are more or less susceptible to acidification. It

(kg SO2-eq) accounts only for acidification caused by SO2 and NOXx. This includes
acidification due to fertilizer use, according to the method developed by the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). CML has based the
characterization factor on the RAINS model developed by the University of
Amsterdam.

Eutrophication is the build-up of a concentration of chemical nutrients in an
ecosystem which leads to abnormal productivity. This causes excessive
plant growth like algae in rivers which causes severe reductions in water
quality and animal populations. This category is based on the work of
Heljungs, and is expressed using the reference unit, kg PO4 3- equivalents.
Direct and indirect impacts of fertilizers are included in the method. The
direct impacts are from production of the fertilizers and the indirect ones
are calculated using the IPCC method to estimate emissions to water
causing eutrophication.

Photochemical Ozone
Creation/Smog Potential
(POCP) (kg 03-eq)

Ozone is protective in the stratosphere, but on the ground-level, it is toxic to
humans in high concentration. Photochemical ozone, also called ground-
level ozone, is formed by the reaction of volatile organic compounds and
nitrogen oxides in the presence of heat and sunlight. The impact category
depends largely on the amounts of carbon monoxide (CO), Sulphur dioxide
(SO2), nitrogen oxide (NO), ammonium and NMVOC (non-methane volatile
organic compounds). Photochemical ozone creation potential (also known
as summer smogj) for emission of substances to air is calculated with the
United Nations Economic Commission for 22 Europe (UNECE) trajectory
model (including fate) and expressed using the reference unit, kg ethylene
(C2H4) equivalent.

Abiotic Depletion Potential
(ADPel and ADPff) (kg Sb-eq)

Inventory metrics

Depletion of non-renewable
material resources (NRM) (kg)

The main concern of this category is the health of humans and the
ecosystem and how it is affected by the extraction of minerals and fossil
fuels, which are inputs into the system. For each extraction of minerals and
fossil fuels, the abiotic depletion factor is determined. This indicator is on a
global scale and is based on the concentration reserves and rate of
deaccumulation. The results are presented in units of the reference
element strontium (i.e. Sb). For the purposes of this EPD, this impact
category is split between mineral elements (i.e. ADPeD and fossil fuels

(ie. ADPFF).

This indicator covers the cumulative life cycle consumption of non-
renewable resources that are extracted from the ground but not including
energy resources like coal, oil and natural gas. This indicator includes the
consumption of metallic ores, aggregates, and other minerals. The units of
