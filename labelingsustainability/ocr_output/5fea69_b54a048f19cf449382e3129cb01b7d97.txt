DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCT AND SCOPE

This EPD is prepared for products classified as UN CPC Group 3744-Cement or CSI MasterFormat
Division 03 30 00 Cast-in-Place Concrete.

This EPD is primary reported Holcim data from the reference year 2022, from January to October. The
cement mix products for Holcim Colombia were completely revamped in June 2022. The mixes in this
reported are the current mixes, produced at the Nobsa cement plant, made from primarily clinker and
limestone. These six cement mixes make up 100% of yearly production at the Nobsa cement plant
from June to October 2022. In order to conduct this study all cement products were modeled but the
products no longer in production were omitted from this report. Cement from the Nobsa cement plant
is used in the EPDSs for concrete mixes in Colombia concrete plants.

This LCA assumes the impacts from products manufactured in accordance with the standards outlined
in this report. This LCA is a cradle-to-gate study, and therefore, stages extending beyond the plant
gate are not included in this LCA. Excluded stages include transportation of the manufactured material
to the construction site: on-site construction processes and components; building (infrastructure) use
and maintenance: and “end-of-life” effects.

For this LCA the manufacturing plant, owned and operated by Holcim Colombia, is located at their
Planta Nobsa facility in Colombia. Al operating data is formulated using the actual data from Holcim
Colombias’'s plant at the above location, including water, energy consumption and waste generation.
Al inputs for this system boundary are calculated for the plant.

This life cycle inventory Was organized in a spreadsheet and Was then input into an RStudio
environment where pre-calculated LCIA results for relevant products/activities stemming from the
ecoinvent v3.8 database and a local EPD database in combination with primary data from Holcim
Colombia were utilized. Explanations of the contribution of each data source to this study are outlined
in the section ‘Data Sources and Quality’. Further LCI details for each declared product are provided in
the sections ‘Detailed LCI tables’ and ‘Transport tables’ of the detailed LCA report. À parameter
uncertainty analysis was also performed where key statistical results (e.g. min/mean/max etc.) are
provided in the detailed LCA report.

ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION

CUT-OFF CRITERIA

ISO 14044:2006 and the focus PCR requires the LCA model to contain a minimum of 95% of the total
inflows (mass and energy) to the upstream and core modules be included in this study. The cut-off
criteria were applied to all other processes unless otherwise noted above as follows. À 1% cut-off is
considered for all renewable and non-renewable primary energy consumption and the total mass of
inputs within a unit process where the total of the neglected inputs does not exceed 5%.

DATA SOURCES AND DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

Raw material transport: À combination of actual mode/distance combinations were assumed for key
bulk materials whereas ecoinvent default multi-modal market mix distances were assumed for other
inputs where no original data could be provided.

Electricity: Holcim Colombia provided primary data for the amount of electricity used in 2022, The unit
process “market for electricity, medium voltage/electricity, medium voltage/CO/KkWh" was used to
represent the amount of electricity used from the national grid of Colombia

Process/space heating: No fuel is used for space heating at this facility in 2022

Fuel required for machinery: Machinery-related fuel requirements were determined from direct
Holcim Colombia calculations for 2022.

Waste generation: Waste generation values are directly reported from Holcim operations for both
bulk waste and hazardous waste. No High-level radioactive waste is generated on-site at this facility

Recovered energy: Not applicable.
Recycled/reused material/components: Not applicable.
Module A1 material Losses: Due to lack of data, default (2%) loss factors were assumed.

Direct A3 emissions accounting: Direct emissions Wwere calculated using adjusted default values. The
carbon released during clinker calcination was calculated using the equation in the IPCC guidelines.
The default value for the fraction of lime in clinker is 64.4% multiplied by the molecular weight ratio of
CO2 and CaO, 0.785. The total is 0.507 tons of CO2/ton of clinker. The emissions from the combustion
of the materials in the kiln are calculated for both fossil and non-fossil CO2 emissions from the fuels
used. The resulting non-CO2 emissions are from the ecoinvent unit process for clinker.

Waste transport requirements: Transportation distances are using estimated values. The waste
hauler cannot guarantee the exact distances traveled due to the variation of route and actual location
of disposal. Most hazardous waste disposal sites are near the plant therefore the 25 km distance is a
representative estimate.

The following tables depict a list of assumed life cycle inventory utilized in the LCA modeling to
generate the impact results across the life cycle modules in scope. An assessment of the quality of
each LCI activities utilized from various sources is also providedl.

DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

Data quality/variability requirements, as specified in the PCR, are applied. This section describes the
achieved data quality relative to the ISO 14044:2006 requirements. Data quality is judged based on its
precision (measured, calculated, or estimated), completeness (eg. unreported emissions), consistency
(degree of uniformity of the methodology applied within a study serving as a data source) and
representativeness (geographical, temporal, and technological).

Precision: Through measurement and calculation, the manufacturers collected and provided primary
data on their annual production. For accuracy, the LCA practitioner and 3rd Party Verifier validated the
plant gate-to-gate data.

Completeness: Al relevant specific processes, including inputs (raw materials, energy, and ancillary
materials) and outputs (emissions and production volume) were considered and modeled to represent
the specified and declared products. Most relevant background materials and processes Were taken
from ecoinvent v3.6 LCI datasets where relatively recent region-specific electricity inputs were utilizedi.
The most relevant EPDs requiring key A1 inputs were also utilized where readily available.

Consistency: To ensure consistency, the same modeling structure across the respective product
systems was ütilized for allinputs, which consisted of raw material inputs and ancillary material, energy
flows, water resource inputs, product, and co-products outputs, returned and recovered Cement
materials, emissions to air, Water and soil, and waste recycling and treatment. The same background
LCI datasets from the ecoinvent v3.6 database were used across all product systems. Crosschecks
concerning the plausibility of mass and energy flows were continuously conducted. The LCA team
conducted mass and energy balances at the plant and selected process level to maintain a high level
of consistency.

Reproducibility: Internal reproducibility is possible since the data and the models are stored and
available in a machine-readable project file for all foreground and background processes, and in Eco-
Purpose's proprietary Cement LCA calculator’ for all production facility and product-specific
calculations. À considerable level of transparency is provided throughout the detailed LCA report as
the specifications and material quantity make-up for the declared products are presented and key
primary and secondary LCI data sources are summarized. The provision of more detailed publicly
accessible data to allow full external reproducibility was not possible due to reasons of confidentiality.

Label Sustainability has developed a proprietary tool that allows the calculation of PCR-compliant LCA
results for Cement product designs. The tool auto-calculates results by scaling base-unit
Technosphere inputs (i.e., 1 kg sand, 1 KWh electricity, etc.) to replicate the reference flow conversions
that take place in any typical LCA software like openLCA or SimaPro. The tool was tested against
several LCAS performed in openLCA and the tool generated identical results to those realized in
openLCA across every impact category and inventory metric (where comparisons could be readily
made).

Representativeness: The representativeness of the data is summarized as follows.

e Time related coverage of the manufacturing processes’ primary collected data from 2021-
01-01 to 2021-12-31.

LABELING SUSTAINABILITY | 11

ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION

e _Upstream (background) LCI data was either the PCR specified default (if applicable) or
more appropriate LCI datasets as found in the country-adjusted ecoinvent v3.6 database.

e _Geographical coverage for inputs required by the A3 facility(ies) is representative of its
region of focus; other upstream and background processes are based on US, North
American, or global average data and adjusted to regional electricity mixes when relevant.

e _Technological coverage is typical or average and specific to the participating facilities for
all primary data.

ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS AND INVENTORY METRICS

Per the PCR, this EPD supports the life cycle impact assessment indicators and inventory metrics as
listed in the tables below. As specified in the PCR, the most recent US EPA Tool for the Reduction and
Assessment of Chemical and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI), impact categories were utilized as
they provide a North American context for the mandatory category indicators to be included in the
EPD. Additionally, the PCR requires a set of inventory metrics to be reported with the LCIA indicators
(see tables below).

It should be noted that emerging LCA impact categories and inventory items are still under
development and can have high levels of uncertainty that preclude international acceptance pending
further development. Use caution when interpreting data in any of the following categories.

LIMITATIONS

This EPD is a declaration of potential environmental impact and does not support or provide definitive
comparisons of the environmental performance of specific products. Only EPDSs prepared from cradle-
to-grave life cycle results and based on the same function and reference service life and quantified by
the same functional unit can be used to assist purchasers and users in making informed comparisons
between products.

LCIA results are relative expressions and do not predict impacts on category endpoints, the exceeding
of thresholds, safety margins or risks. Further, LCA offers a wide array of environmental impact
indicators, and this EPD reports a collection of those, as specified by the PCR.

In addition to the impact results, this EPD provides several metrics related to resource consumption
and waste generation. While these data may be informational in other ways, they do not provide a
measure of impact on the environment.

TOTAL IMPACT SUMMARY

The following table reports the total LCA results for each product produced at the given cement facility
on a per 1 tonne of cement basis.
