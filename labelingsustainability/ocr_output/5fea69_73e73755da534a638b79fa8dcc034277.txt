ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION

COMPANY DESCRIPTION

Holcim Ecuador is part of the international Holcim group, a leader in innovative and sustainable
construction solutions. With more than 100 years of experience in the country producing cement,
concrete, aggregates, and solutions for the construction market. As well as its subsidiary company,
Geocycle reinforces the commitment to the circular economy through the co-processing of waste.
Holcim Ecuador has extensive coverage in the national territory, with an integrated cement plant in
Guayaquil, a cement grinding plant in Latacunga, eleven concrete plants in Guayaquil, Quito, Cuenca,
Manabi, Machala, Quevedo and Ambato, mobile equipment concrete, 2 aggregate plants in Pifo and
Daule, the latter being Loma Alta, the first plant with 52% women in its operations

Per EPD guidelines, carbon credits in any form are not allowed to be part of the calculations. For the
Cement Maestro and MH Holcim Ecuador offsets 100% of their carbon emissions through forestry
offsets. The emissions generated by Holcim Maestro cement are being offset in the Cerro Blanco
Protected Forest, which is in Guayaquil - Salinas Km 16, Chongôn Parish, Guayaquil Canton, Guayas
Province. At X coordinates 609389.32 and Y 9758626.22. Holcim manage 6,072 hectares of native
forest, annually the company supports financially to carry out conservation actions.

The forest contains a very wide biodiversity, it has more than 700 species of plants of which 20% are
endemic to southwestern Ecuador, 75 species of mammals including the jaguar, howler monkeys
and bats, 221 species of birds, 8 amphibian species, among others. (White Hill 2020). The data
obtained indicate that the forest is capturing an average of 2.85 Ton CO2/ha/year. Which has a
typical or standard error of 0.12%. The coefficient of variation is 23.10% and with a sampling error it is
6.93%.

The offset total for Maestro cement is 100% therefore the total GWP of 364 kg CO2eq/ton of cement
is zero if offsets are allowed in reporting outside of this EPD.

STUDY GOAL

The intended application of this life cycle assessment (LCA) is to comply with the procedures for
creating a Type Ill environmental product declaration (EPD) and publish the EPD for public review on
the website, http://labelingsustainability.com/. This level of study is in accordance with EPD
Product Category Rule (PCR) for Cement published by NSF (2020) and is a PCR in accordance with
ISO 21930 for Preparing an Environmental Product Declaration for Portland, Blended Hydraulic,
Masonry, Mortar, and Plastic (Stucco) Cements. EPDSs for cements that follow other PCRs may not be
comparable. International Standards Organization (ISO) 14025:2006 Environmental labels and
declarations, Type Ill environmental declarations-Principles and procedures; ISO 14044:2006
Environmental management, Life cycle assessment- Requirements and guidelines; and ISO
14040:2006 Environmental management, Life cycle assessment-Principles and framework. The
performance of this study and its subsequent publishing is in alignment with the business-to-
business (B2B) communication requirements for the environmental assessment of building products.
The study does not intend to support comparative assertions and is intended to be disclosed to the
public.

This project report was commissioned to differentiate Holcim Ecuador from their competition for the
following reasons: generate an advantage for the organization: offer customers information to help
them make informed product decisions; improve the environmental performance of Holcim Ecuador

by continuously measuring, controlling and reducing the environmental impacts of their products:
help project facilitators working on Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LÉED) projects
achieve their credit goal; and to strengthen Holcim Ecuador's license to operate in the community.
The intended audience for this LCA report is Holcim Ecuador's employees, their suppliers, project
specifiers of their products, architects, and engineers. The EPD report is also available for policy
makers, government officials interested in sustainability, academic professors, and LCA
professionals. This LCA report does not include product comparisons from other facilities.

DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCT AND SCOPE

This EPD is prepared for products classified as UN CPC Group 3744-Cement or CSI MasterFormat
Division 03 30 00 Cast-in-Place Concrete.

This EPDis primary reported Holcim data from the reference year 2021. It reports on the six cement
mixes produced at the Latacunga grinding plant, made from primarily limestone. These six cement
mixes make up 100% of yearly production at the Latacunga grinding plant. Clinked is transported
from the Guayaquil cement plant is used for the cement reported in this EPD.plants. This plant is a
grinding operation and does not operate a kiln.

This LCA assumes the impacts from products manufactured in accordance with the standards
outlined in this report. This LCA is a cradle-to-gate study , and therefore, stages extending beyond
the plant gate are not included in this LCA. Excluded stages include transportation of the
manufactured material to the construction site; on-site construction processes and components;
building (infrastructure) use and maintenance: and “end-of-life” effects.

For this LCA the manufacturing plant, owned and operated by Holcim Ecuador, is located at their
Planta Latacunga facility in Ecuador. Al operating data is formulated using the actual data from
Holcim Ecuador's plant at the above location, including water, energy consumption and waste
generation. AU inputs for this system boundary are calculated for the plant.

This life cycle inventory Was organized in a spreadsheet and was then input into an RStudio
environment where pre-calculated LCIA results for relevant products/activities stemming from the
ecoinvent v3.8 database and a local EPD database in combination with primary data from Holcim
Ecuador were utilized. Explanations of the contribution of each data source to this study are outlined
in the section ‘Data Sources and Quality’. Further LCI details for each declared product are provided
in the sections ‘Detailed LCI tables’ and Transport tables’ of the detailed LCA report. À parameter
uncertainty analysis was also performed where key statistical results (e.g. min/mean/max etc.) are
provided in the detailed LCA report.

ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION

CUT-OFF CRITERIA

ISO 14044:2006 and the focus PCR requires the LCA model to contain a minimum of 95% of the total
inflows (mass and energy) to the upstream and core modules be included in this study. The cut-off
criteria were applied to all other processes unless otherwise noted above as follows. À 1% cut-off is
considered for all renewable and non-renewable primary energy consumption and the total mass of
inputs within a unit process where the total of the neglected inputs does not exceed 5%.

DATA SOURCES AND DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

Raw material transport: À combination of actual mode/distance combinations were assumed for
key bulk materials whereas ecoinvent default multi-modal market mix distances \were assumed for
other inputs where no original data could be provided.

Electricity: Electricity consumption values are for Holcim Ecuador in calendar year 2021. À Power

Purchase Agreement (PPA) is a long-term contract under which a business agrees to purchase
electricity directly from a renewable energy generator. Power Purchase Agreements provide
financial certainty to you and the project developer, which removes a significant roadblock to
building new renewable facilities. Hidroabanico is an Ecuadorian private investment company that
bases its management on Corporate Social Responsibility, which is the new way of managing
companies to operate in an economic, social, and environmentally sustainable way, thus achieving
sustainable development and value creation. The Abanico hydroelectric project is located in the
southeastern region of Ecuador, 15 kilometers from the city of Macas (Morona canton), the capital of
the province of Morona Santiago, in an area far from population centers. Hidroabanico is a run-of-the-
river hydroelectric plant without a reservoir, which controls the excess flow through the spillway and
bottom drains.

Process/space heating: Not applicable.

Fuel required for machinery: Machinery-related fuel requirements were determined from direct
Holcim information for propane use outside the kiln. Propane is used for moving vehicles for raw
materials. Direct emission calculations for propane were calculated with ecoinvent 3.8 unit processes
normalized to the amount of fuel used per ton of cement.

Waste generation: Waste generation values are directly reported from Holcim operations for both
bulk waste and hazardous waste. No High-level radioactive waste is generated on-site at this facility.

Recovered energy: Not Applicable.
Recycled/reused material/components: Not applicable.
Module A1 material Losses: Due to lack of data, default loss factors were assumed.

Direct A3 emissions accounting: This plant is grinding and does not have a kiln: therefore, direct
emissions are for moving vehicles only. Al direct emissions data were calculated from Holcim

LABELING SUSTAINABILITY | 8 @)

ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION

Ecuador direct reporting of fuel usage and ecoinvent default processes for burning those fuels.
Holcim Ecuador does not directly report its emissions.

Waste transport requirements: Transportation distances are using estimated values. The waste
hauler cannot guarantee the exact distances traveled due to the variation of route and actual location
of disposal. Most hazardous waste disposal sites are near the plant therefore the 25 km distance is a

representative estimate.

The following tables depict a list of assumed life cycle inventory utilized in the LCA modeling to
generate the impact results across the life cycle modules in scope. An assessment of the quality of

Data quality/variability requirements, as specified in the PCR, are applied. This section describes the
achieved data quality relative to the ISO 14044:2006 requirements. Data quality is judged based on its

LABELING SUSTAINABILITY | Q

ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION

precision (measured, calculated, or estimated), completeness (e.g. unreported emissions),
consistency (degree of uniformity of the methodology applied within a study serving as a data
source) and representativeness (geographical, temporal, and technological).

Precision: Through measurement and calculation, the manufacturers collected and provided primary
data on their annual production. For accuracy, the LCA practitioner and 3rd Party Verifier validated
the plant gate-to-gate data.

Completeness: Al relevant specific processes, including inputs (raw materials, energy, and ancillary
materials) and outputs (emissions and production volume) were considered and modeled to
represent the specified and declared products. Most relevant background materials and processes
were taken from ecoinvent v3.6 LCI datasets where relatively recent region-specific electricity inputs
were üutilized. The most relevant EPDs requiring key A1 inputs were also utilized where readily
available.

Consistency: To ensure consistency, the same modeling structure across the respective product
systems was utilized for all inputs, which consisted of raw material inputs and ancillary material,
energy flows, water resource inputs, product, and co-products outputs, returned and recovered
Cement materials, emissions to air, water and soil, and waste recycling and treatment. The same
background LCI datasets from the ecoinvent v3.6 database were used across all product systems.
Crosschecks concerning the plausibility of mass and energy flows Were continuously conducted. The
LCA team conducted mass and energy balances at the plant and selected process level to maintain
a high level of consistency.

Reproducibility: Internal reproducibility is possible since the data and the models are stored and
available in a machine-readable project file for all foreground and background processes, and in
Eco-Purpose's proprietary Cement LCA calculator” for all production facility and product-specific
calculations. À considerable level of transparency is provided throughout the detailed LCA report as
the specifications and material quantity make-up for the declared products are presented and key
primary and secondary LCI data sources are summarized. The provision of more detailed publicly
accessible data to allow full external reproducibility was not possible due to reasons of
confidentiality.

Label Sustainability has developed a proprietary tool that allows the calculation of PCR-compliant
LCA results for Cement product designs. The tool auto-calculates results by scaling base-unit
Technosphere inputs (ie. 1 kg sand, 1 kWh electricity, etc.) to replicate the reference flow
conversions that take place in any typical LCA software like openLCA or SimaPro. The tool was
tested against several LCAs performed in openLCA and the tool generated identical results to those
realized in openLCA across every impact category and inventory metric (where comparisons could
be readily made).

Representativeness: The representativeness of the data is summarized as follows.

e Time related coverage of the manufacturing processes’ primary collected data from
2020-01-01 to 2020-12-31.

e _ Upstream (background) LCI data was either the PCR specified default (if applicable) or
more appropriate LCI datasets as found in the country-adjusted ecoinvent v3.6 database.

ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS AND INVENTORY METRICS ——

Per the PCR, this EPD supports the life cycle impact assessment indicators and inventory metrics as
listed in the tables below. As specified in the PCR, the most recent US EPA Tool for the Reduction
and Assessment of Chemical and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI, impact categories were
utilized as they provide a North American context for the mandatory category indicators to be
included in the EPD. Additionally, the PCR requires a set of inventory metrics to be reported with the
LCIA indicators (see tables below).

ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION

LIMITATIONS

This EPDis a declaration of potential environmental impact and does not support or provide
definitive comparisons of the environmental performance of specific products. Only EPDS prepared
from cradle-to-grave life cycle results and based on the same function and reference service life and
quantified by the same functional unit can be used to assist purchasers and users in making informed
comparisons between products.

LCIA results are relative expressions and do not predict impacts on category endpoints, the
exceeding of thresholds, safety margins or risks. Further, LCA offers a wide array of environmental
impact indicators, and this EPD reports a collection of those, as specified by the PCR.

In addition to the impact results, this EPD provides several metrics related to resource consumption
and waste generation. While these data may be informational in other ways, they do not provide a
measure of impact on the environment.

TOTAL IMPACT SUMMARY

The following table reports the total LCA results for each product produced at the given cement
facility on a per 1 tonne of cement basis.
