audience for this LCA report is Holcim México Operaciones, S.A. de CVs employees, their suppliers,
project specifiers of their products, architects, and engineers. The EPD report is also available for
policy makers, government officials interested in sustainability, academic professors, and LCA
professionals. This LCA report does not include product comparisons from other facilities.

DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCT AND SCOPE

This EPD is primary reported Holcim México Operaciones SA de CV data from the reference year
2020 and uses direct reported Holcim México Operaciones SA de CV information whenever possible.
This includes both the cement plant and the concrete plant. This EPD accounts for primary
information and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reports for the Tecoman cement plant, used for the
cement raw material input for all concrete mixes listed in this EPD.

This LCA assumes the impacts from products manufactured in accordance with the standards
ouütlined in this report. This LCA is a cradle-to-gate study, and therefore, stages extending beyond the
plant gate are not included in this LCA. Excluded stages include transportation of the manufactured

material to the construction site: on-site construction processes and components; building
(infrastructure) use and maintenance: and “end-of-life” effects.

For this LCA the manufacturing plant, owned and operated by Holcim México Operaciones, SA. de
C.V. is located at their Tlaquepaque (KTPZ) Concrete Plant facility in Mexico. Al operating data is
formulated using the actual data from Holcim México Operaciones, SA. de C.V'Ss plant at the above
Location, including water, energy consumption and waste generation. Al inputs for this system
boundary are calculated for the plant.

This life cycle inventory Was organized in à spreadsheet and was then input into an RStudio
environment where pre-calculated LCIA results for relevant products/activities stemming from the
ecoinvent V3.6 database and a local EPD database in combination with primary data from Holcim
México Operaciones, SA. de C.V. were utilized. Explanations of the contribution of each data source
to this study are outlined in the section ‘Data Sources and Quality’. Further LCI details for each
declared product are provided in the sections ‘Detailed LCI tables’ and ‘Transport tables’ of the
detailed LCA report. À parameter uncertainty analysis was also performed where key statistical

LABELING SUSTAINABILITY | 8 @

ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION

results (e.g. min/mean/max etc.) are provided in the detailed LCA report.

CUT-OFF CRITERIA

ISO 14044:2006 and the focus PCR requires the LCA model to contain a minimum of 95% of the total
inflows (mass and energy) to the upstream and core modules be included in this study. The cut-off
criteria were applied to all other processes unless otherwise noted above as follows. À 1% cut-off is
considered for all renewable and non-renewable primary energy consumption and the total mass of
inputs within a unit process where the total of the neglected inputs does not exceed 5%.

DATA SOURCES AND DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

The following table summarizes the facility's (i.e. A3) electricity consumption and generation (if
applicable), process/space heating requirements, fuel inputs for on-site machinery, and waste
generation.

The following statements explain how the above facility requirements/generation were derived:

Raw material transport: A combination of actual mode/distance combinations were assumed for
key bulk materials whereas ecoinvent default multi-modal market mix distances were assumed for
other inputs Where no original data could be provided.

Electricity: Electricity generation and consumption values were based on monthly utility bills. By
constitutional law, electricity for public service consumption was provided by state-owned CFE and
LFC until October 2009. Prior to October 2009, LEC served Mexico City and the surrounding areas
and CFE served the rest of the country. LFC bought approximately 95 percent of its electricity from
CFE. In October 2009 CFE took over LFC's operations.

Process/space heating: Al values for energy, water and waste are Holcim direct reporting for the
year 2020.

LABELING SUSTAINABILITY | 9 @

ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION

Fuel required for machinery: Waste values were based on waste management receipts for 2020.
The types of hazardous waste include: absorbent material impregnated with hazardous chemicals:
containers, tow, fabrics impregnated with solvents, oil, spent grease: residual liquids from solvents or
hazardous chemicals; empty containers; and personal protective equipment impregnated with oils,
greases or dangerous chemicals. Non-hazardous waste includes both organic and inorganic waste.

Waste generation: Volume of concrete returned from truck \Wwashing using a retention pond system.
Recovered energy: Due to lack of data, default loss factors were assumedl.

Recycled/reused material/components: Market values were used for waste due to the
undetermined nature of the waste's final destination. Not all materials are a simple landfill solution.

Wash water returned is through a retention pond system.

Module A1 material Losses: Primary transportation for delivering the concrete in mixing trucks was
calculated using the following formula; Total concrete transported/(concrete/load) (km per load)

L/km.

Direct A3 emissions accounting: NA

Waste transport requirements: NA

Product transport requirements: NA

DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

Data quality/variability requirements, as specified in the PCR, are applied. This section describes the
achieved data quality relative to the ISO 14044:2006 requirements. Data quality is judged based on its
precision (measured, calculated, or estimated), completeness (e.g. unreported emissions),
consistency (degree of uniformity of the methodology applied within a study serving as a data
source) and representativeness (geographical, temporal, and technological).

Precision: Through measurement and calculation, the manufacturers collected and provided primary
data on their annual production. For accuracy, the LCA practitioner and 3rd Party Verifier validated
the plant gate-to-gate data.

Completeness: Al relevant specific processes, including inputs (raw materials, energy, and ancillary
materials) and outputs (emissions and production volume) were considered and modeled to
represent the specified and declared products. Most relevant background materials and processes
were taken from ecoinvent v3.6 LCI datasets where relatively recent region-specific electricity inputs
were utilized. The most relevant EPDs requiring key A1 inputs were also utilized where readily
available.

Consistency: To ensure consistency, the same modeling structure across the respective product
systems was utilized for all inputs, which consisted of raw material inputs and ancillary material,
energy flows, water resource inputs, product, and co-products outputs, returned and recovered
Ready Mix Concrete materials, emissions to air, water and soil, and waste recycling and treatment.
The same background LCI datasets from the ecoinvent v3.6 database were used across all product
systems. Crosschecks concerning the plausibility of mass and energy flows Wwere continuously
conducted. The LCA team conducted mass and energy balances at the plant and selected process
level to maintain a high level of consistency,.

Reproducibility: Internal reproducibility is possible since the data and the models are stored and
available in a machine-readable project file for all foreground and background processes, and in
Eco-Purpose's proprietary Ready Mix Concrete LCA calculator” for all production facility and
product-specific calculations. À considerable level of transparency is provided throughout the
detailed LCA report as the specifications and material quantity make-up for the declared products
are presented and key primary and secondary LCI data sources are summarized. The provision of
more detailed publicly accessible data to allow full external reproducibility was not possible due to
reasons of confidentiality.

‘Eco-Purpose has developed a proprietary tool that allows the calculation of PCR-compliant LCA
results for Ready Mix Concrete product designs. The tool auto-calculates results by scaling base-unit
Technosphere inputs (Le. 1 kg sand, 1 KWh electricity, etc.) to replicate the reference flow
conversions that take place in any typical LCA software like openLCA or SimaPro. The tool was
tested against several LCAs performed in openLCA and the tool generated identical results to those

realized in openLCA across every impact category and inventory metric (where comparisons could
be readily made).

Representativeness: The representativeness of the data is summarized as follows.

e Time related coverage of the manufacturing processes’ primary collected data from
2020-01-01 to 2020-12-31.

e Upstream (background) LCI data was either the PCR specified default (if applicable) or
more appropriate LCI datasets as found in the country-adjusted ecoinvent V3.6 database.

e _Geographical coverage for inputs required by the A3 facility(ies) is representative of its
region of focus; other upstream and background processes are based on US, North
American, or global average data and adjusted to regional electricity mixes when
relevant.

e Technological coverage is typical or average and specific to the participating facilities for
all primary data.

ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS AND INVENTORY METRICS —

Per the PCR, this EPD supports the life cycle impact assessment indicators and inventory metrics as
listed in the tables below. As specified in the PCR, the most recent US EPA Tool for the Reduction
and Assessment of Chemical and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI), impact categories were
utilized as they provide a North American context for the mandatory category indicators to be
included in the EPD. Addlitionally, the PCR requires a set of inventory metrics to be reported with the
LCIA indicators (see tables below).

Global Warming Potential or climate change can be defined as the change in
global temperature caused by the greenhouse effect that the release of
greenhouse gases by human activity creates. The Environmental Profiles
characterization model is based on factors developed by the United Nations
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Factors are expressed as
Global Warming Potential over the time horizon of different years, being the
most common 100 years (GWP100), measured in the reference unit, kg CO2
equivalent.

Ozone-depleting gases cause damage to stratospheric ozone or the ozone
layer. CFCSs, halons and HCFCSs are the major causes of ozone depletion. The
characterization model has been developed by the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) and defines the ozone depletion potential of different
gases relative to the reference substance chlorofluorocarbon-11 (CFC-11),
expressed in kg CFC-11 equivalent.

Acidic gases such as Sulphur dioxide (SO2) react with water in the atmosphere
to form acid rain, a process known as acid deposition. Acidification potential is
expressed using the reference unit, kg SO2 equivalent. The model does not
take account of regional differences in terms of which areas are more or Less
susceptible to acidification. It accounts only for acidification caused by SO2 and
NOx. This includes acidification due to fertilizer use, according to the method
developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). CML has
based the characterization factor on the RAINS model developed by the
University of Amsterdam.

Eutrophication is the build-up of a concentration of chemical nutrients in an
ecosystem which leads to abnormal productivity. This causes excessive plant
growth like algae in rivers which causes severe reductions in water quality and
animal populations. This category is based on the work of Heijungs, and is
expressed using the reference unit, kg PO4 3- equivalents. Direct and indirect
impacts of fertilizers are included in the method. The direct impacts are from
production of the fertilizers and the indirect ones are calculated using the IPCC
method to estimate emissions to water causing eutrophication.

Ozone is protective in the stratosphere, but on the ground-level, it is toxic to
humans in high concentration. Photochemical ozone, also called ground-level
ozone, is formed by the reaction of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen
oxides in the presence of heat and sunlight. The impact category depends
largely on the amounts of carbon monoxide (CO), Sulphur dioxide (SO2),
nitrogen oxide (NO), ammonium and NMVOC (non-methane volatile organic
compounds). Photochemical ozone creation potential (also known as summer
smogj) for emission of substances to air is calculated with the United Nations
Economic Commission for 22 Europe (UNECE) trajectory model (including fate)
and expressed using the reference unit, kg ethylene (C2H4) equivalent.

The main concern of this category is the health of humans and the ecosystem
and how it is affected by the extraction of minerals and fossil fuels, which are
inputs into the system. For each extraction of minerals and fossil fuels, the
abiotic depletion factor is determined. This indicator is on a global scale and is
based on the concentration reserves and rate of deaccumulation. The results
are presented in units of the reference element strontium (i.e. Sb). For the
purposes of this EPD, this impact category is split between mineral elements
(i.e. ADPel and fossil fuels (i.e. ADPff).
