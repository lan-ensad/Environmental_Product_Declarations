COMPANY DESCRIPTION

Holcim Mexico produces and markets cement, ready-mix concrete, and other products and services
for construction. The company has a nationwide presence through 7 cement plants with a current
installed capacity to produce 12.6 million tons per year, 23 cement distribution centers, two maritime
terminals, 1 Corporate Office, plus 35 ready-mix concrete plants, seven platforms, and a Geocycle
transfer center, 26 commercial partners with more than 90 ready-mix concrete plants, more than 500
mixing pots, one aggregates plant and a Technological Innovation Center for Construction (CITEC).

Sustainable Development is an integral part of Holcim's strategy around the world. Holcim Mexico has
a clear vision of the future it wants for our country, which contributes to its development. Holcim
Mexico's main objective is to create value. Creating value ensures long-term business success in
covering the triple bottom line (ie. social, economic, environmental values). Finally, good operating
performance and a solid return on invested capital go hand in hand with sustainable development.

Holcim continues to invest in research and development. They have the Innovation and Development
Center, located in Lyon (France), with satellite locations in various regions developing a comprehensive
portfolio of innovators and sustainable solutions. These include different categories: inclusive business
models, water management solutions, urban mining solutions (recycled aggregates), waste treatment
services, energy-efficient solutions (insulating building materials), resource-efficient solutions (high
recycled content, bags soluble cement), and low CO2 building materials.

Holcim operates with the belief that they can gain an advantage by developing knowledge and brand
equity in the green building segment.

STUDY GOAL

The intended application of this life cycle assessment (LCA) is to comply with the procedures for
creating a Type Ill environmental product declaration (EPD) and publish the EPD for public review on
the website, http://labelingsustainability.com/ . This Level of study is in accordance with EPD Product
Category Rule (PCR) for Cement published by NSF (2020) and is a PCR in accordance with ISO 21930
for Preparing an Environmental Product Declaration for Portland, Blended Hydraulic, Masonry, Mortar,
and Plastic (Stucco) Cements. EPDs for cements that follow other PCRS may not be comparable.
International Standards Organization (ISO) 14025:2006 Environmental labels and declarations, Type Il
environmental declarations-Principles and procedures; ISO 14044:2006 Environmental management,
Life cycle assessment- Requirements and guidelines: and ISO 14040:2006 Environmental
management, Life cycle assessment-Principles and framework. The performance of this study and its
subsequent publishing is in alignment with the business-to-business (B2B) communication
requirements for the environmental assessment of building products. The study does not intend to
support comparative assertions and is intended to be disclosed to the public.

This project report was commissioned to differentiate Holcim México Operaciones SA de CV from their
competition for the following reasons: generate an advantage for the organization; offer customers
information to help them make informed product decisions; improve the environmental performance
of Holcim México Operaciones SA de CV by continuously measuring, controlling and reducing the
environmental impacts of their products: help project facilitators working on Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design (LEED) projects achieve their credit goal; and to strengthen Holcim México

ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION

Operaciones SA de CV's license to operate in the community. The intended audience for this LCA
report is Holcim México Operaciones SA de CV's employees, their suppliers, project specifiers of their
products, architects, and engineers. The EPD report is also available for policy makers, government
officials interested in sustainability, academic professors, and LCA professionals. This LCA report does
not include product comparisons from other facilities.

Only EPDs prepared from cradle-to-grave life-cycle results and based on the same function, reference
service life, and quantified by the same functional unit, can be used to assist purchasers and users in
making informed comparisons between products. Since EPDs developed under these PCR only cover
the cradle-to-gate impacts of portland, blended hydraulic, masonry, mortar, or plastic (stucco)
cements, using a declared unit, the results cannot be used to compare products used in different
mixtures and construction products. The results from a portland, blended hydraulic, masonry, mortar,
or plastic (stucco) cements EPD must be integrated into a comprehensive cradle-to-grave, ISO 14044-
compliant LCA in order to compare between different products. The basis of a comparison, where
applicable, shall include the product application in accordance with ISO 21930 ASTM (2014).

The PCR for cement, as listed as the SUubPCR used as a guidance document, includes a variety of ASTM
specifications for cement. None of the ASTM standards listed in the PCR covers Rapid Set Cement.
Rapid Set Cement falls under ASTM C1600; This is a performance-based specification for hydraulic
cement in the same vein as ASTM C1157, included in the PCR. Representatives of CTS Cement
appealed to the PCR committee, including the committee chair from NSF. CTS appeals were denied.
The difference between the ASTM C1157 specification, which is included in the PCR, and the ASTM
C1600 specification, under which Rapid Set Cement falls, is that ASTM C1600 includes rapid-hardening
cement. C1157 excludes rapid hardening cement as it requires a minimum set time of 45 minutes.

DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCT AND SCOPE

This EPD is prepared for products classified as UN CPC Group 3744-Cement or CSI MasterFormat
Division 03 30 00 Cast-in-Place Concrete.

This EPD is primary reported Holcim data from the reference year 2023. It reports on the four Portland
cement mixes produced at the Ramos Arizpe cement plant, made from primarily limestone. These four
cement mixes make up 100% of yearly production at the Ramos Arizpe cement plant. Cement from the
Ramos Arizpe cement plant is used in the EPDs for concrete mixes for the following plants: Dulces
Nombres, Escobedo, Mitras, Obispo, Pesqueria, Santa Catarina, Artega, Ramos Arizpe, and
Derramadero which cover both the Monterrey and Saltillo regions of Mexico.

This LCA assumes the impacts from products manufactured in accordance with the standards outlined
in this report. This LCA is a cradle-to-gate study, and therefore, stages extending beyond the plant
gate are not included in this LCA. Excluded stages include transportation of the manufactured material
to the construction site: on-site construction processes and components; building (infrastructure) use
and maintenance: and “end-of-life” effects.

ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION

In addition, as according to the relevant PCR, the following requirements are excluded from this study:

e Production, manufacture and construction of A3 building/capital goods and infrastructure:

e Production and manufacture of steel production equipment, steel delivery vehicles, earth-

For this LCA the manufacturing plant, owned and operated by Holcim México Operaciones SA de CV,
is located at their Ramos Arizpe Cement Plant facility in Mexico. Al operating data is formulated using
the actual data from Holcim México Operaciones SA de CV's plant at the above location, including
water, energy consumption and waste generation. Al inputs for this system boundary are calculated
for the plant.

This life cycle inventory Was organized in a spreadsheet and was then input into an RStudio
environment where pre-calculated LCIA results for relevant products/activities stemming from the
ecoinvent v3.0 database and a local EPD database in combination with primary data from Holcim
México Operaciones SA de CV were utilized. Explanations of the contribution of each data source to
this study are outlined in the section ‘Data Sources and Quality’. Further LCI details for each declared
product are provided in the sections ‘Detailed LCI tables’ and ‘Transport tables’ of the detailed LCA
report. À parameter uncertainty analysis was also performed where key statistical results (e.g.
min/mean/max etc.) are provided in the detailed LCA report.

CUT-OFF CRITERIA

ISO 14044:2006 and the focus PCR requires the LCA model to contain a minimum of 95% of the total
inflows (mass and energy) to the upstream and core modules be included in this study. The cut-off
criteria were applied to all other processes unless otherwise noted above as follows. À 1% cut-off is
considered for all renewable and non-renewable primary energy consumption and the total mass of
inputs within a unit process where the total of the neglected inputs does not exceed 5%.

DATA SOURCES AND DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

Raw material transport: À combination of actual mode/distance combinations were assumed for key
bulk materials wWhereas ecoinvent default multi-modal market mix distances were assumed for other
inputs where no original data could be provided.

Electricity: Electricity generation and consumption values were based on monthly utility bills and
Holcim's 2020 GHG emissions reports. This facility uses both CFE, Mexico's main utility and lberdrola,
an alternate energy provider that does not use oil or coal as part of their energy mix. An
Iberdrolaspecific process Was created With lberdrola's unique mix. Since they would not release
information about their exact energy mix transmitted to cement plant, assumptions were made based
on available data on nominal capacities of each generation technology and average annual capacity
factors for each energy production type. Further information can be found in the section Additional
Information.

LABELING SUSTAINABILITY | 9

ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION

Process/space heating: All fuel consumed for process/space heating was accounted for using direct
emission calculations. See A3 emissions explanation.

Fuel required for machinery: All on-site machinery emission values used ecoinvent 310-unit
processes. Diesel has been used for fire system, emergency plant, utility cars, trackmobil and
construction machinery apart from that no other type of fuel has been used by the plant.

Waste generation: Waste generation values are directly reported from Holcim operations.

Recovered energy: Not Applicable.

Recycled/reused material/components: Al the kiln dust from the cement processing is used as
input to other Holcim products and/or processes.

Module A1 material Losses: Due to lack of data, default loss factors \vere assumed.

Direct A3 emissions accounting: All direct emissions were entered using à hybrid of direct Holcim
emissions calculations from their yearly GHG Facility-Level Emissions report and LCI ecoinvent unit

processes.

Waste transport requirements: Holcim direct reporting waste and non-hazardous waste ve used with
default calculations for waste hauling.

The following tables depict a list of assumed life cycle inventory utilized in the LCA modeling to
generate the impact results across the life cycle modules in scope. An assessment of the quality of

DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

Data quality/variability requirements, as specified in the PCR, are applied. This section describes the
achieved data quality relative to the ISO 14044:2006 requirements. Data quality is judged based on its
precision (measured, calculated, or estimated), completeness (e.g. unreported emissions), consistency

LABELING SUSTAINABILITY | 11

ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION

(degree of uniformity of the methodology applied within a study serving as à data source) and
representativeness (geographical, temporal, and technological).

Precision: Through measurement and calculation, the manufacturers collected and provided primary
data on their annual production. For accuracy, the LCA practitioner and 3rd Party Verifier validated the
plant gate-to-gate data.

Completeness: Al relevant specific processes, including inputs (raw materials, energy, and ancillary
materials) and outputs (emissions and production volume) were considered and modeled to represent
the specified and declared products. Most relevant background materials and processes Were taken
from ecoinvent v310 LCI datasets where relatively recent region-specific electricity inputs were
utilized. The most relevant EPDSs requiring key A1 inputs were also utilized where readily available.

Consistency: To ensure consistency, the same modeling structure across the respective product
systems was utilized for all inputs, which consisted of raw material inputs and ancillary material, energy
flows, water resource inputs, product, and co-products outputs, returned and recovered Cement
materials, emissions to air, Water and soil, and waste recycling and treatment. The same background
LCI datasets from the ecoinvent v310 database were used across all product systems. Crosschecks
concerning the plausibility of mass and energy flows were continuously conducted. The LCA team
conducted mass and energy balances at the plant and selected process level to maintain a high level
of consistency.

Reproducibility: Internal reproducibility is possible since the data and the models are stored and
available in a machine-readable project file for all foreground and background processes, and in Eco-
Purpose's proprietary Cement LCA calculator' for all production facility and product-specific
calculations. À considerable level of transparency is provided throughout the detailed LCA report as
the specifications and material quantity make-up for the declared products are presented and key
primary and secondary LCI data sources are summarized. The provision of more detailed publicly
accessible data to allow full external reproducibility was not possible due to reasons of confidentiality.

Labeling Sustainability has developed à proprietary tool that allows the calculation of PCR-compliant
LCA results for Cement product designs. The tool auto-calculates results by scaling base-unit
Technosphere inputs (i.e. 1 kg sand, 1 KWh electricity, etc.) to replicate the reference flow conversions
that take place in any typical LCA software like openLCA or SimaPro. The tool was tested against
several LCAS performed in openLCA and the tool generated identical results to those realized in
openLCA across every impact category and inventory metric (where comparisons could be readily
made).

Representativeness: The representativeness of the data is summarized as follows.

e Time related coverage of the manufacturing processes’ primary collected data from 2023-
01-01 to 2023-12-31.

e Upstream (background) LCI data was either the PCR specified default (if applicable) or
more appropriate LCI datasets as found in the country-adjusted ecoinvent v3.10 database.

e  Geographical coverage for inputs required by the A3 facilitylies) is representative of its
region of focus; other upstream and background processes are based on US, North
American, or global average data and adjusted to regional electricity mixes when relevant.

e _Technological coverage is typical or average and specific to the participating facilities for
all primary data.

ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS AND INVENTORY METRICS ——

Per the PCR, this EPD supports the life cycle impact assessment indicators and inventory metrics as
listed in the tables below. As specified in the PCR, the most recent US EPA Tool for the Reduction and
Assessment of Chemical and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI), impact categories were utilized as
they provide a North American context for the mandatory category indicators to be included in the
EPD. Additionally, the PCR requires a set of inventory metrics to be reported with the LCIA indicators
(see tables below).

ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION

LIMITATIONS

This EPD is a declaration of potential environmental impact and does not support or provide definitive
comparisons of the environmental performance of specific products. Only EPDSs prepared from cradle-
to-grave life cycle results and based on the same function and reference service life and quantified by
the same functional unit can be used to assist purchasers and users in making informed comparisons
between products.

LCIA results are relative expressions and do not predict impacts on category endpoints, the exceeding
of thresholds, safety margins or risks. Further, LCA offers a wide array of environmental impact
indicators, and this EPD reports a collection of those, as specified by the PCR.

In addition to the impact results, this EPD provides several metrics related to resource consumption
and waste generation. While these data may be informational in other ways, they do not provide a
measure of impact on the environment.

TOTAL IMPACT SUMMARY

The following table reports the total LCA results for each product produced at the given cement facility
on a per 1 tonne of cement basis.
