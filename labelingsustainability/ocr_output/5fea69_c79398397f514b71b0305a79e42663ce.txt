COMPANY DESCRIPTION

Holcim (Nicaragua) SA was born in 1997 as a result of the union of a group of distinguished
Nicaraguan investors and Holcim Ltd. The Company is part of the Holcim Group, formerly the
LafargeHolcim Group, created in July 2015, as a result of the merger of Holcim and Lafarge.

Holcim Nicaragua is a member of the international group of the same name, leader in the
construction materials industry, operating in Nicaragua for 23 years, producing cement, concrete,
aggregates and solutions for the construction market. The company offer different types of cement
solutions with special qualities: Holcim Fuerte EcoPlanet, Holcim Industrial and Holcim Superbloque,
our leading Fuerte EcoPlanet cement has ECO Labels that guarantee a cement With 35% less CO2
emissions per ton.

Currently, Holcim (Nicaragua) SA, with a cement production capacity of more than 400,000 tons per
year, occupies a preferential place among consumers, an achievement obtained from product
quality, technical support and excellence in customer service. The company has a cement grinding
plant in Nagarote, a fixed concrete plant in Managua, mobile concrete equipment in Chinandega, and
an aggregates plant in Cofradia. It have Disensa, the largest hardware network in the country,
generating value for the owners of more than 78 points of sale and their clients with a presence in 14
departments and two autonomous regions of Nicaragua.

STUDY GOAL

The intended application of this life cycle assessment (LCA) is to comply with the procedures for
creating a Type Ill environmental product declaration (EPD) and publish the EPD for public review on
the website, http://labelingsustainability.com/. This level of study is in accordance with EPD
Product Category Rule (PCR) for Ready Mix Concrete published by NSF International (2019) and is a
sub-PCR of International Standards Organization (ISO) 21930:2017 Sustainability in buildings and civil
works - Core rules for EPDs of construction products and services; International Standards
Organization (ISO) 14025:2006 Environmental labels and declarations, Type Ill environmental
declarations-Principles and procedures; ISO 14044:2006 Environmental management, Life cycle
assessment- Requirements and guidelines; and ISO 14040:2006 Environmental management, Life
cycle assessment-Principles and framework. The performance of this study and its subsequent
publishing is in alignment with the business-to-business (B2B) communication requirements for the
environmental assessment of building products. The study does not intend to support comparative
assertions and is intended to be disclosed to the public.

This project report was commissioned to differentiate Holcim Nicaragua from their competition for
the following reasons: generate an advantage for the organization: offer customers information to
help them make informed product decisions; improve the environmental performance of Holcim
Nicaragua by continuously measuring, controlling and reducing the environmental impacts of their
products; help project facilitators working on Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)
projects achieve their credit goal; and to strengthen Holcim Nicaragua's license to operate in the
community. The intended audience for this LCA report is Holcim Nicaragua's employees, their
suppliers, project specifiers of their products, architects, and engineers. The EPD report is also
available for policy makers, government officials interested in sustainability, academic professors,
and LCA professionals. This LCA report does not include product comparisons from other facilities.

DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCT AND SCOPE

This EPD reports on 62 concrete mixes manufactured at the KM12 Holcim Nicaragua concrete facility

in Managua, Nicaragua.

This LCA assumes the impacts from products manufactured in accordance with the standards
outlined in this report. This LCA is a cradle-to-gate study, and therefore, stages extending beyond the
plant gate are not included in this LCA. Excluded stages include transportation of the manufactured

material to the construction site: on-site construction processes and components; building

(infrastructure) use and maintenance: and “end-of-life” effects.

e Personnel-related activities (travel, furniture, office supplies).

e Energy use related to company management and sales activities.

For this LCA the manufacturing plant, owned and operated by Holcim Nicaragua, is located at their
KM12 facility in Nicaragua. Al operating data is formulated using the actual data from Holcim
Nicaragua's plant at the above location, including water, energy consumption and waste generation.
Al inputs for this system boundary are calculated for the plant.

This life cycle inventory Was organized in a spreadsheet and was then input into an RStudio
environment where pre-calculated LCIA results for relevant products/activities stemming from the
ecoinvent v3.8 database and a local EPD database in combination with primary data from Holcim
Nicaragua were utilized. Explanations of the contribution of each data source to this study are
outlined in the section ‘Data Sources and Quality’. Further LCI details for each declared product are
provided in the sections ‘Detailed LCI tables’ and ‘Transport tables’ of the detailed LCA report. A
parameter uncertainty analysis was also performed where key statistical results (e.g. min/mean/max
etc.) are provided in the detailed LCA report.

CUT-OFF CRITERIA

ISO 14044:2006 and the focus PCR requires the LCA model to contain a minimum of 95% of the total
inflows (mass and energy) to the upstream and core modules be included in this study. The cut-off

criteria were applied to all other processes unless otherwise noted above as follows. À 1% cut-off is
considered for all renewable and non-renewable primary energy consumption and the total mass of
inputs within a unit process where the total of the neglected inputs does not exceed 5%.

DATA SOURCES AND DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

The following table summarizes the facility's (i.e. A3) electricity consumption and on-site generation
or off-site contractual procurement (if applicable), process/space heating requirements, fuel inputs

The following statements explain how the above facility requirements/generation were derived:

Raw material transport: À combination of actual mode/distance combinations were assumed for
key bulk materials whereas ecoinvent default multi-modal market mix distances were assumed for
other inputs where no original data could be provided.

Electricity: No grid electricity is consumed at this plant. À diesel powered generator is deployed at
site to meet the electricity requirements of the plant.

Process/space heating: No fuel is used for space Heating at this plant.

Fuel required for machinery: Machinery-related fuel requirements were determined from direct
Holcim information. The types of machinery used include generators, pumps to pump concrete to
higher elevations, and transportation equipment used for moving materials. This plant does not have
electricity therefore it uses diesel to power generators.

Waste generation: Waste generation values are directly reported from Holcim operations for bulk
waste. No hazardous or high-level radioactive waste is generated on-site at this facility. Wash water
for trucks Was also primary reported data for 2022.

DER
ô LABELING SUSTAINABILITY 10 Hu HOLCIM
ENVIRONMENTAL FPRODUCT DECLARATIONM

Recovered energy: Not applicable.

Recycled/reused material/components: The amount of returned concrete is based on Holcim
primary data for the reference year, 2022.

Module A1 material Losses: Due to lack of data, default loss factors of 5% \vere assumed. The PCR
states ” A3 shall include an assumption of 5% material Loss unless product specific data is available
and transparently reported in the project LCA report underlying the EPD;"

Direct A3 emissions accounting: Direct emissions for the on-site machinery use the actual fuel
consumption and the ecoinvent database to calculate those emissions.

Waste transport requirements: Transportation distances are using estimated values. The waste
hauler cannot guarantee the exact distances traveled due to the variation of route and actual location
of disposal. Most waste disposal sites are near the plant therefore the 25 km distance is a
representative estimate. Returned concrete and Wash water, measured in kilograms, is based on
direct Holcim reporting for the reference year 2022.

Product transport requirements: The diesel fuel used by the mixing trucks is direct primary
information reported from Holcim Nicaragua records for the year 2022. Holcim records their fuel for
their trucks in /km and therefore the information was converted with the following formula: (Ave. km
to site)’ 2 for return L diesel/km / (ave. m3 of concrete in a load) total concrete volume in m3
fraction allocated to A3. A4 is outside the scope of this study.

DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

Data quality/variability requirements, as specified in the PCR, are applied. This section describes the
achieved data quality relative to the ISO 14044:2006 requirements. Data quality is judged based on its
precision (measured, calculated, or estimated), completeness (e.g. unreported emissions),
consistency (degree of uniformity of the methodology applied within a study serving as a data
source) and representativeness (geographical, temporal, and technological).

Precision: Through measurement and calculation, the manufacturers collected and provided primary
data on their annual production. For accuracy, the LCA practitioner and 3rd Party Verifier validated
the plant gate-to-gate data.

Completeness: All relevant specific processes, including inputs (raw materials, energy, and ancillary
materials) and outputs (emissions and production volume) were considered and modeled to
represent the specified and declared products. The majority of relevant background materials and
processes were taken from ecoinvent v3.8 LCI datasets where relatively recent region-specific
electricity inputs were utilized. The most relevant EPDs requiring key A1 inputs were also utilized
where readily available.

Consistency: To ensure consistency, the same modeling structure across the respective product
systems was utilized for all inputs, which consisted of raw material inputs and ancillary material,
energy flows, water resource inputs, product, and co-products outputs, returned and recovered
Cement materials, emissions to air, water and soil, and waste recycling and treatment. The same
background LCI datasets from the ecoinvent v3.8 database were used across all product systems.
Crosschecks concerning the plausibility of mass and energy flows were continuously conducted. The
LCA team conducted mass and energy balances at the plant and selected process level to maintain
a high level of consistency.

Reproducibility: Internal reproducibility is possible since the data and the models are stored and
available in a machine readable project file for all foreground and background processes, and in
Labeling Sustainability's proprietary Ready Mix Concrete LCA calculator” for all production facility
and product-specific calculations. À considerable level of transparency is provided throughout the
detailed LCA report as the specifications and material quantity make-up for the declared products
are presented and key primary and secondary LCI data sources are summarized. The provision of
more detailed publicly accessible data to allow full external reproducibility was not possible due to

reasons of confidentiality.

‘Labeling Sustainability has developed a proprietary tool that allows the calculation of PCR-
compliant LCA results for Ready Mix Concrete product designs. The tool auto-calculates results by
scaling base-unit technosphere inputs (ie. 1 kg sand, 1 KWh electricity, etc.) to replicate the reference
flow conversions that take place in any typical LCA software like openLCA or SimaPro. The tool was
tested against several LCASs performed in openLCA and the tool generated identical results to those
realized in openLCA across every impact category and inventory metric (where comparisons could
be readily made).

Representativeness: The representativeness of the data is summarized as follows.

e Time related coverage of the manufacturing processes’ primary collected data from
2021-01-01 to 2021-12-31.

e _ Upstream (background) LCI data was either the PCR specified default (if applicable) or
more appropriate LCI datasets as found in the country-adjusted ecoinvent v3.8 database.

e _Geographical coverage for inputs required by the A3 facility(ies) is representative of its
region of focus; other upstream and background processes are based on US, North
American, or global average data and adjusted to regional electricity mixes when
relevant.

e Technological coverage is typical or average and specific to the participating facilities for
all primary data.

ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS AND INVENTORY METRICS —

Per the PCR, this EPD supports the life cycle impact assessment indicators and inventory metrics as
listed in the tables below. As specified in the PCR, the most recent US EPA Tool for the Reduction
and Assessment of Chemical and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI), impact categories were
utilized as they provide a North American context for the mandatory category indicators to be
included in the EPD. Additionally, the PCR requires a set of inventory metrics to be reported with the
LCIA indicators (see tables below).

following table:

Table 15: Definitions of life cycle impact categories and life cycle inventory metrics

Midpoint impact categories

Global Warming Potential
(GWP) (units: kg CO2-eq)

Global Warming Potential or climate change can be defined as the change in
global temperature caused by the greenhouse effect that the release of
greenhouse gases by human activity creates. The Environmental Profiles
characterization model is based on factors developed by the United Nations
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Factors are expressed as
Global Warming Potential over the time horizon of different years, being the
most common 100 years (GWP100), measured in the reference unit, kg CO2
equivalent.

Ozone Depletion Potential
(ODP) (kg CFC-11-eq)

Ozone-depleting gases cause damage to stratospheric ozone or the ozone
layer. CFCSs, halons and HCFCSs are the major causes of ozone depletion. The
characterization model has been developed by the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) and defines the ozone depletion potential of different
gases relative to the reference substance chlorofluorocarbon-11 (CFC-11),
expressed in kg CFC-11 equivalent.

Acidification Potential (AP) (kg
SO2-edq)

Acidic gases such as Sulphur dioxide (SO2) react with water in the atmosphere
to form acid rain, a process known as acid deposition. Acidification potential is
expressed using the reference unit, kg SO2 equivalent. The model does not
take account of regional differences in terms of which areas are more or Less
susceptible to acidification. It accounts only for acidification caused by SO2 and
NOx. This includes acidification due to fertilizer use, according to the method
developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). CML has
based the characterization factor on the RAINS model developed by the
University of Amsterdam.

Eutrophication Potential (EP)
(PO4 3- -eq)

Eutrophication is the build-up of a concentration of chemical nutrients in an
ecosystem which leads to abnormal productivity. This causes excessive plant
growth like algae in rivers which causes severe reductions in water quality and
animal populations. This category is based on the work of Heïjungs, and is
expressed using the reference unit, kg PO4 3- equivalents. Direct and indirect
impacts of fertilizers are included in the method. The direct impacts are from
production of the fertilizers and the indirect ones are calculated using the IPCC
method to estimate emissions to Water causing eutrophication.

Photochemical Ozone
Creation/Smog Potential
(POCP) (kg 03-eq)

Ozone is protective in the stratosphere, but on the ground-level, it is toxic to
humans in high concentration. Photochemical ozone, also called ground-level
ozone, is formed by the reaction of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen
oxides in the presence of heat and sunlight. The impact category depends
largely on the amounts of carbon monoxide (CO), Sulphur dioxide (SO2),
nitrogen oxide (NO), ammonium and NMVOC (non-methane volatile organic
compounds). Photochemical ozone creation potential (also known as summer

ô LABELING SUSTAINABILITF

ENVIRONMENTAL FPRODUCT DECLARATIONM

smogj) for emission of substances to air is calculated with the United Nations
Economic Commission for 22 Europe (UNECE) trajectory model (including fate)
and expressed using the reference unit, kg ethylene (C2H4) equivalent.

Abiotic Depletion Potential
(ADPel and ADPff) (kg Sb-eq)

Inventory metrics

Depletion of non-renewable
material resources (NRM) (kg)

The main concern of this category is the health of humans and the ecosystem
and how it is affected by the extraction of minerals and fossil fuels, which are
inputs into the system. For each extraction of minerals and fossil fuels, the
abiotic depletion factor is determined. This indicator is on a global scale and is
based on the concentration reserves and rate of deaccumulation. The results
are presented in units of the reference element strontium (ie. Sb). For the
purposes of this EPD, this impact category is split between mineral elements
(ie. ADPel and fossil fuels (i.e. ADPFf).

This indicator covers the cumulative life cycle consumption of non-renewable
resources that are extracted from the ground but not including energy
resources like coal, oil and natural gas. This indicator includes the consumption
of metallic ores, aggregates, and other minerals. The units of measure are in
terms of kilograms material extracted and utilized/wasted in the life cycle
system considered.

Use of renewable material
resources (RM) (kg)

This indicator covers the cumulative life cycle consumption of renewable
resources that are extracted from nature like sustainably harvested biomass.
The units of measure are in terms of kilograms material extracted and
utilized/wasted in the life cycle system considered.

Depletion of non-renewable
energy resources (NRE) (MJ
HHV)

This indicator considers the cumulative life cycle consumption of non-
renewable energy resources like oil, natural gas, and coal. The units of measure
are in terms of Mega-Joules of energy resource extracted and utilized/wasted
in the life cycle system considered.

Use of renewable primary
energy (RE) (MJ HHV)

This indicator considers the cumulative life cycle extraction of renewable
energy resources from nature like solar and wind energy as well as biomass for
energy purposes. The units of measure are in terms of Mega-Joules of energy
resource extracted and utilized/wasted in the life cycle system considered.

Total primary energy
consumption (PEC) (MJ HHV)

This indicator is the summation of non-renewable and renewable energy
extracted from nature, where the units of measure are in terms of Mega-Joules
of energy resource extracted/utilized/Wwasted in the life cycle system
considered.

Water Depletion Potential
(WDP) (m3)

This indicator considers the cumulative life cycle consumption of water
required to produced the declared functional unit of a given product. The units
of measure are in cubic meters of water consumed.

Concrete batching water

This indicator is defined as the direct water Used in concrete mix batches. The

consumption (CBWC) (m3) units of measure are in cubic meters of water consumedl.
Concrete washing water This indicator is defined as the direct washing water used at the facility. The
consumption (CWWC) (m3) units of measure are in cubic meters of wash water consumed.

Concrete hazardous waste
(CHW) (kg)

This indicator considers the amount of hazardous waste waste generated at the
concrete facility. The units of measure are in kilograms of waste generated.

Concrete non-hazardous waste
(CNHW) (kg)

This indicator considers the direct amount of non-hazardous waste generated
at the concrete facility. The units of measure are in kilograms of waste
generated.

It should be noted that emerging LCA impact categories and inventory items are still under
development and can have high levels of uncertainty that preclude international acceptance
pending further development. Use caution when interpreting data in any of the following categories.
