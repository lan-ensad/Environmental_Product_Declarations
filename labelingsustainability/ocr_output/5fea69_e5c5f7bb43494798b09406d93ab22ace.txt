ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION

COMPANY DESCRIPTION ——————————————
Holcim Mexico produces and markets cement, ready-mix concrete, and other products and services
for construction. The company has a nationwide presence through 7 cement plants with a current
installed capacity to produce 12.6 million tons per year, 23 cement distribution centers, two maritime
terminals, 1 Corporate Office, plus 35 ready-mix concrete plants, seven platforms, and a Geocycle
transfer center, 26 commercial partners with more than 90 ready-mix concrete plants, more than 500
mixing pots, one aggregates plant and a Technological Innovation Center for Construction (CITEC).

Sustainable Development is an integral part of Lafarge Holcim's strategy around the world. Holcim
Mexico has a clear vision of the future it wants for our country, which contributes to its development.
Holcim Mexico's main objective is to create value. Creating value ensures long-term business
success in covering the triple bottom line (i.e. social, economic, environmental values). Finally, good
operating performance and a solid return on invested capital go hand in hand with sustainable
development.

Holcim continues to invest in research and development. They have the Innovation and Development
Center, located in Lyon (France), with satellite Locations in various regions developing a
comprehensive portfolio of innovators and sustainable solutions. These include different categories:
inclusive business models, water management solutions, urban mining solutions (recycled
aggregates), waste treatment services, energy-efficient solutions (insulating building materials),
resource-efficient solutions (high recycled content, bags soluble cement), and low CO2 building
materials.

Holcim operates with the belief that they can gain an advantage by developing knowledge and
brand equity in the green building segment.

STUDY GOAL

The intended application of this life cycle assessment (LCA) is to comply with the procedures for
creating a Type Ill environmental product declaration (EPD) and publish the EPD for public review on
the website, http://labelingsustainability.com/ . This level of study is in accordance with EPD
Product Category Rule (PCR) for Ready Mix Concrete published by NSF International (2019) and is a
sub-PCR of International Standards Organization (ISO) 21930:2017 Sustainability in buildings and civil
works - Core rules for EPDs of construction products and services; International Standards
Organization (ISO) 14025:2006 Environmental labels and declarations, Type Ill environmental
declarations-Principles and procedures; ISO 14044:2006 Environmental management, Life cycle
assessment- Requirements and guidelines; and ISO 14040:2006 Environmental management, Life
cycle assessment-Principles and framework. The performance of this study and its subsequent
publishing is in alignment with the business-to-business (B2B) communication requirements for the
environmental assessment of building products. The study does not intend to support comparative
assertions and is intended to be disclosed to the public.

This project report was commissioned to differentiate Holcim México Operaciones S.A. de C.V. from
their competition for the following reasons: generate an advantage for the organization: offer
customers information to help them make informed product decisions; improve the environmental
performance of Holcim México Operaciones SA. de C.V. by continuously measuring, controlling and
reducing the environmental impacts of their products; help project facilitators working on Leadership
in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) projects achieve their credit goal, and to strengthen

Holcim México Operaciones S.A. de CVs license to operate in the community. The intended
audience for this LCA report is Holcim México Operaciones SA. de C.V's employees, their suppliers,
project specifiers of their products, architects, and engineers. The EPD report is also available for
policy makers, government officials interested in sustainability, academic professors, and LCA
professionals. This LCA report does not include product comparisons from other facilities.

DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCT AND SCOPE

This EPD reports on 54 concrete mixes manufactured at the Holcim Mexico Operaciones SA. de C.V.
Xochimilco concrete facility in Ciudad de Mexico, México.

This LCA assumes the impacts from products manufactured in accordance with the standards
outlined in this report. This LCA is a cradle-to-gate study, and therefore, stages extending beyond the
plant gate are not included in this LCA. Excluded stages include transportation of the manufactured
material to the construction site; on-site construction processes and components; building
(infrastructure) use and maintenance: and “end-of-life” effects.

ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION

For this LCA the manufacturing plant, owned and operated by Holcim México Operaciones SA. de
CV, is located at their Planta Xochilmilco facility in México. All operating data is formulated using the
actual data from Holcim México Operaciones SA. de C.V's plant at the above location, including
water, energy consumption and waste generation. Al inputs for this system boundary are calculated
for the plant.

This life cycle inventory Was organized in a spreadsheet and was then input into an RStudio
environment where pre-calculated LCIA results for relevant products/activities stemming from the
ecoinvent V3.8 database and a local EPD database in combination with primary data from Holcim
México Operaciones SA. de C.V. were utilized. Explanations of the contribution of each data source to
this study are outlined in the section ‘Data Sources and Quality’. Further LCI details for each declared
product are provided in the sections ‘Detailed LCI tables’ and ‘Transport tables’ of the detailed LCA
report. À parameter uncertainty analysis was also performed where key statistical results (e.g.
min/mean/max etc.) are provided in the detailed LCA report.

CUT-OFF CRITERIA

ISO 14044:2006 and the focus PCR requires the LCA model to contain a minimum of 95% of the total
inflows (mass and energy) to the upstream and core modules be included in this study. The cut-off
criteria were applied to all other processes unless otherwise noted above as follows. À 1% cut-off is
considered for all renewable and non-renewable primary energy consumption and the total mass of
inputs within a unit process where the total of the neglected inputs does not exceed 5%.

DATA SOURCES AND DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

Raw material transport: À combination of actual mode/distance combinations were assumed for
key bulk materials whereas ecoinvent default multi-modal market mix distances were assumed for
other inputs Where no original data could be providedl.

Electricity: Electricity consumption values are for Holcim Mexico in calendar year 2022. These values
were direct reported from Holcim records. The unit process “market for electricity, medium
voltage/electricity, medium voltage/MX/KWh" was used to represent the Mexico grid electricity
used by the concrete plant.

Process/space heating: No fuel is used for space heating at this plant.

Fuel required for machinery: Machinery-related fuel requirements were determined from direct
Holcim information. The types of machinery used include generators, pumps to pump concrete to
higher elevations, and transportation equipment used for moving materials.

Waste generation: Waste generation values are directly reported from Holcim operations for both
bulk waste and hazardous waste. No High-level radioactive waste is generated on-site at this facility.
Wash \Wwater values are direct reported water use from Holcim México for 2022.

Recovered energy: Not applicable.

Recycled/reused material/components: The amount of returned concrete is based on Holcim
primary data for the reference year, 2022.

LABELING SUSTAINABILITY | 10

ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION

Module A1 material Losses: Due to lack of data, default loss factors of 5% were assumed. The PCR
states” A3 shall include an assumption of 5% material loss unless product specific data is available
and transparently reported in the project LCA report underlying the EPD;

Direct A3 emissions accounting: Direct emissions are modeled using fuel and technology
appropriate ecoinvent activities. See LCI input tables for details.

Waste transport requirements: Transportation distances are using estimated values. The waste
hauler cannot guarantee the exact distances traveled due to the variation of route and actual location
of disposal. Most waste disposal sites are near the plant therefore the 25 km distance is a
representative estimate. Returned concrete and Wash Water, measured in kilograms, is based on
direct Holcim reporting for the reference year 2022.

Product transport requirements: The diesel fuel used by the mixing trucks is direct primary
information reported from Holcim México records for the year 2022. The concrete PCR allots 30% of
the overall mixing truck total for stage A3 (manufacturing) for mixing the materials.

The following tables depict a list of assumed life cycle inventory utilized in the LCA modeling to
generate the impact results across the life cycle modules in scope. An assessment of the quality of
each LCI activities utilized from various sources is also provided.

DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

Data quality/variability requirements, as specified in the PCR, are applied. This section describes the
achieved data quality relative to the ISO 14044:2006 requirements. Data quality is judged based on its
precision (measured, calculated, or estimated), completeness (e.g. unreported emissions),
consistency (degree of uniformity of the methodology applied within a study serving as a data
source) and representativeness (geographical, temporal, and technological).

Precision: Through measurement and calculation, the manufacturers collected and provided primary
data on their annual production. For accuracy, the LCA practitioner and 3rd Party Verifier validated
the plant gate-to-gate data.

Completeness: Al relevant specific processes, including inputs (raw materials, energy, and ancillary
materials) and outputs (emissions and production volume) were considered and modeled to
represent the specified and declared products. The majority of relevant background materials and
processes were taken from ecoinvent V3.8 LCI datasets where relatively recent region-specific
electricity inputs were utilized. The most relevant EPDs requiring key A1 inputs were also utilized
where readily available.

Consistency: To ensure consistency, the same modeling structure across the respective product

systems was utilized for all inputs, which consisted of raw material inputs and ancillary material,
energy flows, water resource inputs, product, and co-products outputs, returned and recovered

ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION

Ready Mix Concrete materials, emissions to air, water and soil, and waste recycling and treatment.
The same background LCI datasets from the ecoinvent v3.8 database Wwere used across all product
systems. Crosschecks concerning the plausibility of mass and energy flows were continuously
conducted. The LCA team conducted mass and energy balances at the plant and selected process
level to maintain a high level of consistency,.

Reproducibility: Internal reproducibility is possible since the data and the models are stored and
available in a machine readable project file for all foreground and background processes, and in
Labeling Sustainability's proprietary Ready Mix Concrete LCA calculator’ for all production facility
and product-specific calculations. À considerable level of transparency is provided throughout the
detailed LCA report as the specifications and material quantity make-up for the declared products
are presented and key primary and secondary LCI data sources are summarized. The provision of
more detailed publicly accessible data to allow full external reproducibility was not possible due to

reasons of confidentiality.

‘Labeling Sustainability has developed a proprietary tool that allows the calculation of PCR-
compliant LCA results for Ready Mix Concrete product designs. The tool auto-calculates results by
scaling base-unit technosphere inputs (ie. 1 kg sand, 1 KWh electricity, etc.) to replicate the reference
flow conversions that take place in any typical LCA software like openLCA or SimaPro. The tool was
tested against several LCAs performed in openLCA and the tool generated identical results to those
realized in openLCA across every impact category and inventory metric (where comparisons could
be readily made).

Representativeness: The representativeness of the data is summarized as follows.

e Time related coverage of the manufacturing processes’ primary collected data from
2022-01-01 to 2022-12-31.

e Upstream (background) LCI data was either the PCR specified default (if applicable) or
more appropriate LCI datasets as found in the country-adjusted ecoinvent V3.8 database.

e _Geographical coverage for inputs required by the A3 facility(ies) is representative of its
region of focus; other upstream and background processes are based on US, North
American, or global average data and adjusted to regional electricity mixes when
relevant.

e Technological coverage is typical or average and specific to the participating facilities for
all primary data.

ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS AND INVENTORY METRICS

Per the PCR, this EPD supports the life cycle impact assessment indicators and inventory metrics as
listed in the tables below. As specified in the PCR, the most recent US EPA Tool for the Reduction
and Assessment of Chemical and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI), impact categories were
utilized as they provide a North American context for the mandatory category indicators to be
included in the EPD. Addlitionally, the PCR requires a set of inventory metrics to be reported with the
LCIA indicators (see tables below).

It should be noted that emerging LCA impact categories and inventory items are still under

development and can have high levels of uncertainty that preclude international acceptance
pending further development. Use caution when interpreting data in any of the following categories.
