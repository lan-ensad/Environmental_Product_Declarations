For this LCA the manufacturing plant, owned and operated by Holcim México Operaciones S.A. de
CV, is located at their Planta Lerma facility in México. Al operating data is formulated using the
actual data from Holcim México Operaciones SA. de C.V's plant at the above location, including
water, energy consumption and waste generation. Al inputs for this system boundary are calculated
for the plant.

This life cycle inventory Was organized in a spreadsheet and was then input into an RStudio
environment where pre-calculated LCIA results for relevant products/activities stemming from the
ecoinvent V3.8 database and a local EPD database in combination with primary data from Holcim
México Operaciones SA. de C.V. were utilized. Explanations of the contribution of each data source to
this study are outlined in the section ‘Data Sources and Quality’. Further LCI details for each declared
product are provided in the sections ‘Detailed LCI tables’ and ‘Transport tables’ of the detailed LCA
report. À parameter uncertainty analysis was also performed where key statistical results (e.g.
min/mean/max etc.) are provided in the detailed LCA report.

CUT-OFF CRITERIA

ISO 14044:2006 and the focus PCR requires the LCA model to contain a minimum of 95% of the total
inflows (mass and energy) to the upstream and core modules be included in this study. The cut-off
criteria were applied to all other processes unless otherwise noted above as follows. À 1% cut-off is
considered for all renewable and non-renewable primary energy consumption and the total mass of
inputs within a unit process where the total of the neglected inputs does not exceed 5%.

The following statements explain how the above facility requirements/generation were derived':

Raw material transport: À combination of actual mode/distance combinations were assumed for
key bulk materials whereas ecoinvent default multi-modal market mix distances were assumed for
other inputs Where no original data could be providedl.

Electricity: Electricity consumption values are for Holcim Mexico in calendar year 2022. These values
were direct reported from Holcim records. The unit process “market for electricity, medium
voltage/electricity, medium voltage/MX/KWh" was used to represent the Mexico grid electricity
used by the concrete plant.

Process/space heating: No fuel is used for space heating at this plant.

Fuel required for machinery: Machinery-related fuel requirements were determined from direct
Holcim information. The types of machinery used include generators, pumps to pump concrete to
higher elevations, and transportation equipment used for moving materials.

Waste generation: Waste generation values are directly reported from Holcim operations for both
bulk waste and hazardous waste. No High-level radioactive waste is generated on-site at this facility.
Wash \Wwater values are direct reported water use from Holcim México for 2022.

Recovered energy: Not applicable.

ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION

Recycled/reused material/components: The amount of returned concrete is based on Holcim
primary data for the reference year, 2022.

Module A1 material Losses: Due to lack of data, default loss factors of 5% Were assumed. The PCR
states” A3 shall include an assumption of 5% material loss unless product specific data is available
and transparently reported in the project LCA report underlying the EPD;"

Direct A3 emissions accounting: Direct emissions are modeled using fuel and technology
appropriate ecoinvent activities. See LCI input tables for details.

Waste transport requirements: Transportation distances are using estimated values. The waste
hauler cannot guarantee the exact distances traveled due to the variation of route and actual location
of disposal. Most waste disposal sites are near the plant therefore the 25 km distance is a
representative estimate. Returned concrete and wash water, measured in kilograms, is based on
direct Holcim reporting for the reference year 2022.

Product transport requirements: The diesel fuel used by the mixing trucks is direct primary
information reported from Holcim México records for the year 2022. The concrete PCR allots 30% of
the overall mixing truck total for stage A3 (manufacturing) for mixing the materials.

The following tables depict a list of assumed life cycle inventory utilized in the LCA modeling to
generate the impact results across the life cycle modules in scope. An assessment of the quality of
each LCI activities utilized from various sources is also provided.

DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

Data quality/variability requirements, as specified in the PCR, are applied. This section describes the
achieved data quality relative to the ISO 14044:2006 requirements. Data quality is judged based on its
precision (measured, calculated, or estimated), completeness (e.g. unreported emissions), consistency
(degree of uniformity of the methodology applied within a study serving as à data source) and
representativeness (geographical, temporal, and technological).

Precision: Through measurement and calculation, the manufacturers collected and provided primary
data on their annual production. For accuracy, the LCA practitioner and 3rd Party Verifier validated the
plant gate-to-gate data.

Completeness: Al relevant specific processes, including inputs (raw materials, energy, and ancillary
materials) and outputs (emissions and production volume) were considered and modeled to represent
the specified and declared products. The majority of relevant background materials and processes
were taken from ecoinvent v3.8 LCI datasets where relatively recent region-specific electricity inputs
were utilized. The most relevant EPDs requiring key A1 inputs were also utilized where readily available.

Consistency: To ensure consistency, the same modeling structure across the respective product
systems was utilized for all inputs, which consisted of raw material inputs and ancillary material, energy
flows, water resource inputs, product, and co-products outputs, returned and recovered Ready Mix
Concrete materials, emissions to air, Water and soil, and waste recycling and treatment. The same
background LCI datasets from the ecoinvent v3.8 database were used across all product systems.

ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION

Crosschecks concerning the plausibility of mass and energy flows were continuously conducted. The
LCA team conducted mass and energy balances at the plant and selected process level to maintain a
high level of consistency.

Reproducibility: Internal reproducibility is possible since the data and the models are stored and
available in a machine readable project file for all foreground and background processes, and in
Labeling Sustainability's proprietary Ready Mix Concrete LCA calculator” for all production facility and
product-specific calculations. À considerable level of transparency is provided throughout the detailed
LCA report as the specifications and material quantity make-up for the declared products are
presented and key primary and secondary LCI data sources are summarized. The provision of more
detailed publicly accessible data to allow full external reproducibility was not possible due to reasons

of confidentiality.

‘Labeling Sustainability has developed a proprietary tool that allows the calculation of PCR-compliant
LCA results for Ready Mix Concrete product designs. The tool auto-calculates results by scaling base-
unit technosphere inputs (i.e.1 kg sand, 1 KWh electricity, etc.) to replicate the reference flow
conversions that take place in any typical LCA software like openLCA or SimaPro. The tool was tested
against several LCAs performed in openLCA and the tool generated identical results to those realized
in openLCA across every impact category and inventory metric (where comparisons could be readily
made).

Representativeness: The representativeness of the data is summarized as follows.

e Time related coverage of the manufacturing processes’ primary collected data from 2022-
01-01 to 2022-12-31.

e Upstream (background) LCI data was either the PCR specified default (if applicable) or
more appropriate LCI datasets as found in the country-adjusted ecoinvent V3.8 database.

e  Geographical coverage for inputs required by the A3 facilitylies) is representative of its
region of focus; other upstream and background processes are based on US, North
American, or global average data and adjusted to regional electricity mixes when relevant.

e Technological coverage is typical or average and specific to the participating facilities for
all primary data.

ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS AND INVENTORY METRICS

Per the PCR, this EPD supports the life cycle impact assessment indicators and inventory metrics as
listed in the tables below. As specified in the PCR, the most recent US EPA Tool for the Reduction and
Assessment of Chemical and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI), impact categories were utilized as
they provide a North American context for the mandatory category indicators to be included in the
EPD. Additionally, the PCR requires a set of inventory metrics to be reported with the LCIA indicators
(see tables below).

À summary description of each of the impact categories and inventory metrics is provided in the
following table:

Table 14: Definitions of life cycle impact categories and life cycle inventory metrics

Midpoint impact categories

Global Warming Potential or climate change can be defined as the change in
global temperature caused by the greenhouse effect that the release of
greenhouse gases by human activity creates. The Environmental Profiles
Global Warming Potential characterization model is based on factors developed by the United Nations
(GWP) (units: kg CO2-eq) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCO). Factors are expressed as
Global Warming Potential over the time horizon of different years, being the
most common 100 years (GWP100), measured in the reference unit, kg CO2
equivalent.

Ozone-depleting gases cause damage to stratospheric ozone or the ozone
layer. CFCSs, halons and HCFCSs are the major causes of ozone depletion. The
Ozone Depletion Potential characterization model has been developed by the World Meteorological
(ODP) (kg CFC-11-eq) Organization (WMO) and defines the ozone depletion potential of different
gases relative to the reference substance chlorofluorocarbon-11 (CFC-11),
expressed in kg CFC-11 equivalent.

Acidic gases such as Sulphur dioxide (SO2) react with water in the atmosphere
to form acid rain, a process known as acid deposition. Acidification potential is
expressed using the reference unit, kg SO2 equivalent. The model does not
take account of regional differences in terms of which areas are more or less
susceptible to acidification. It accounts only for acidification caused by SO2 and
NOx. This includes acidification due to fertilizer use, according to the method
developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). CML has
based the characterization factor on the RAINS model developed by the
University of Amsterdam.

Eutrophication is the build-up of a concentration of chemical nutrients in an
ecosystem which leads to abnormal productivity. This causes excessive plant
growth like algae in rivers which causes severe reductions in water quality and

animal populations. This category is based on the work of Heijungs, and is
expressed using the reference unit, kg PO4 3- equivalents. Direct and indirect
impacts of fertilizers are included in the method. The direct impacts are from
production of the fertilizers and the indirect ones are calculated using the IPCC
method to estimate emissions to water causing eutrophication.

Photochemical Ozone
Creation/Smog Potential
(POCP) (kg 03-eq)

Ozone is protective in the stratosphere, but on the ground-level, it is toxic to
humans in high concentration. Photochemical ozone, also called ground-level
ozone, is formed by the reaction of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen
oxides in the presence of heat and sunlight. The impact category depends
largely on the amounts of carbon monoxide (CO), Sulphur dioxide (SO2),
nitrogen oxide (NO), ammonium and NMVOC (non-methane volatile organic
compounds). Photochemical ozone creation potential (also known as summer
smog) for emission of substances to air is calculated with the United Nations
Economic Commission for 22 Europe (UNECE) trajectory model (including fate)
and expressed using the reference unit, kg ethylene (C2H4) equivalent.

Abiotic Depletion Potential
(ADPel and ADPff) (kg Sb-eq)

Inventory metrics

Depletion of non-renewable
material resources (NRM) (kg)

The main concern of this category is the health of humans and the ecosystem
and how it is affected by the extraction of minerals and fossil fuels, which are
inputs into the system. For each extraction of minerals and fossil fuels, the
abiotic depletion factor is determined. This indicator is on a global scale and is
based on the concentration reserves and rate of deaccumulation. The results
are presented in units of the reference element strontium (i.e. Sb). For the
purposes of this EPD, this impact category is split between mineral elements
(ie. ADPel and fossil fuels (i.e. ADPFf).

This indicator covers the cumulative life cycle consumption of non-renewable
resources that are extracted from the ground but not including energy
resources like coal, oil and natural gas. This indicator includes the consumption
of metallic ores, aggregates and other minerals. The units of measure are in
terms of kilograms material extracted and utilized/wasted in the life cycle
system considered.

Use of renewable material
resources (RM) (kg)

This indicator covers the cumulative life cycle consumption of renewable
resources that are extracted from nature like sustainably harvested biomass.
The units of measure are in terms of kilograms material extracted and
utilized/wasted in the life cycle system considered.

Depletion of non-renewable
energy resources (NRE) (MJ
HHV)

This indicator considers the cumulative life cycle consumption of non-
renewable energy resources like oil, natural gas, and coal. The units of measure
are in terms of Mega-Joules of energy resource extracted and utilized/Wwasted
in the life cycle system considered.

Use of renewable primary
energy (RE) (MJ HHV)

This indicator considers the cumulative life cycle extraction of renewable
energy resources from nature like solar and wind energy as well as biomass for
energy purposes. The units of measure are in terms of Mega-Joules of energy
resource extracted and utilized/wasted in the life cycle system considered.

Total primary energy
consumption (PEC) (MJ HHV)

This indicator is the summation of non-renewable and renewable energy
extracted from nature, where the units of measure are in terms of Mega-Joules
of energy resource extracted/utilized/wasted in the life cycle system
considered.

Water Depletion Potential
(WDP) (m3)

This indicator considers the cumulative life cycle consumption of water
required to produce the declared functional unit of a given product. The units
of measure are in cubic meters of \water consumedl.

Concrete batching water
consumption (CB\WC) (m3)

This indicator is defined as the direct water used in concrete mix batches. The
units of measure are in cubic meters of water consumed.

LABELING SUSTAINABILITY | 17

ENVIRONMENTAL PRODUCT DECLARATION

Concrete washing water This indicator is defined as the direct washing water used at the facility. The
consumption (CW\WC) (m3) units of measure are in cubic meters of \wash Water consumedl.

Concrete hazardous waste This indicator considers the amount of hazardous waste generated at the
(CHW) (kg) concrete facility. The units of measure are in kilograms of waste generated.

This indicator considers the direct amount of non-hazardous waste generated
at the concrete facility. The units of measure are in kilograms of waste
generated.

Concrete non-hazardous waste
