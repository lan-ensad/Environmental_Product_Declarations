DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCT AND SCOPE

This EPD reports on 29 concrete mixes manufactured at the KM14 Holcim Nicaragua concrete facility

in Managua, Nicaragua.

This LCA assumes the impacts from products manufactured in accordance with the standards outlined
in this report. This LCA is a cradle-to-gate study, and therefore, stages extending beyond the plant
gate are not included in this LCA. Excluded stages include transportation of the manufactured material
to the construction site: on-site construction processes and components; building (infrastructure) use
and maintenance: and “end-of-life” effects.

For this LCA the manufacturing plant, owned and operated by Holcim Nicaragua, is located at their
KM14 facility in Nicaragua. All operating data is formulated using the actual data from Holcim
Nicaragua's plant at the above location, including water, energy consumption and waste generation.
Al inputs for this system boundary are calculated for the plant.

This life cycle inventory Was organized in a spreadsheet and Was then input into an RStudio
environment where pre-calculated LCIA results for relevant products/activities stemming from the
ecoinvent v3.8 database and a local EPD database in combination with primary data from Holcim
Nicaragua were utilized. Explanations of the contribution of each data source to this study are outlined
in the section ‘Data Sources and Quality’. Further LCI details for each declared product are provided in
the sections ‘Detailed LCI tables’ and ‘Transport tables’ of the detailed LCA report. À parameter
uncertainty analysis was also performed where key statistical results (e.g. min/mean/max etc.) are
provided in the detailed LCA report.

CUT-OFF CRITERIA

ISO 14044:2006 and the focus PCR requires the LCA model to contain a minimum of 95% of the total
inflows (mass and energy) to the upstream and core modules be included in this study. The cut-off
criteria were applied to all other processes unless otherwise noted above as follows. À 1% cut-off is
considered for all renewable and non-renewable primary energy consumption and the total mass of
inputs within a unit process where the total of the neglected inputs does not exceed 5%.

DATA SOURCES AND DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

The following statements explain how the above facility requirements/generation were derived':

Raw material transport: A combination of actual mode/distance combinations were assumed for key
bulk materials whereas ecoinvent default multi-modal market mix distances were assumed for other
inputs where no original data could be provided.

Electricity: No grid electricity is consumed at this plant. À diesel powered generator is deployed at site
to meet the electricity requirements of the plant.

Process/space heating: No fuel is used for space Heating at this plant.

Fuel required for machinery: Machinery-related fuel requirements \Wwere determined from direct
Holcim information. The types of machinery used include generators, pumps to pump concrete to
higher elevations, and transportation equipment used for moving materials. This plant does not have
electricity therefore it uses diesel to power generators.

Waste generation: Waste generation values are directly reported from Holcim operations for bulk
waste. No hazardous or high-level radioactive waste is generated on-site at this facility. Wash water
for trucks Was also primary reported data for 2022.

Recovered energy: Not applicable.

Recycled/reused material/components: The amount of returned concrete is based on Holcim
primary data for the reference year, 2022.

Module A1 material Losses: Due to lack of data, default loss factors of 5% were assumed. The PCR
states ” A3 shall include an assumption of 5% material loss unless product specific data is available and
transparently reported in the project LCA report underlying the EPD;"

ô LABELING SUSTAINABILITY 8 Hu HOLCIM
ENVIRONMENTAL FPRODUCT DECLARATIONM

Direct A3 emissions accounting: Direct emissions for the on-site machinery use the actual fuel
consumption and the ecoinvent database to calculate those emissions.

Waste transport requirements: Transportation distances are using estimated values. The waste hauler
cannot guarantee the exact distances traveled due to the variation of route and actual location of
disposal. Most waste disposal sites are near the plant therefore the 25 km distance is a representative
estimate. Returned concrete and Wash water, measured in kilograms, is based on direct Holcim
reporting for the reference year 2022.

Product transport requirements: The diesel fuel used by the mixing trucks is direct primary
information reported from Holcim Nicaragua records for the year 2022. Holcim records their fuel for
their trucks in L/km and therefore the information was converted with the following formula: (Ave. km
to site)’ 2 for return L diesel/km / (ave. m3 of concrete in a load) total concrete volume in m3 * fraction
allocated to A3. A4 is outside the scope of this study.

DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

Data quality/variability requirements, as specified in the PCR, are applied. This section describes the
achieved data quality relative to the ISO 14044:2006 requirements. Data quality is judged based on its
precision (measured, calculated, or estimated), completeness (eg. unreported emissions), consistency
(degree of uniformity of the methodology applied within a study serving as a data source) and
representativeness (geographical, temporal, and technological).

Precision: Through measurement and calculation, the manufacturers collected and provided primary
data on their annual production. For accuracy, the LCA practitioner and 3rd Party Verifier validated the
plant gate-to-gate data.

Completeness: All relevant specific processes, including inputs (raw materials, energy, and ancillary
materials) and outputs (emissions and production volume) were considered and modeled to represent
the specified and declared products. The majority of relevant background materials and processes
were taken from ecoinvent v3.8 LCI datasets where relatively recent region-specific electricity inputs
were utilized. The most relevant EPDs requiring key A1 inputs were also utilized where readily available.

Consistency: To ensure consistency, the same modeling structure across the respective product
systems was ütilized for allinputs, which consisted of raw material inputs and ancillary material, energy
flows, water resource inputs, product, and co-products outputs, returned and recovered Cement
materials, emissions to air, Water and soil, and waste recycling and treatment. The same background
LCI datasets from the ecoinvent v3.8 database were used across all product systems. Crosschecks
concerning the plausibility of mass and energy flows were continuously conducted. The LCA team
conducted mass and energy balances at the plant and selected process level to maintain a high level
of consistency.

Reproducibility: Internal reproducibility is possible since the data and the models are stored and
available in a machine readable project file for all foreground and background processes, and in
Labeling Sustainability's proprietary Ready Mix Concrete LCA calculator” for all production facility and
product-specific calculations. À considerable level of transparency is provided throughout the detailed
LCA report as the specifications and material quantity make-up for the declared products are
presented and key primary and secondary LCI data sources are summarized. The provision of more
detailed publicly accessible data to allow full external reproducibility was not possible due to reasons

of confidentiality.

‘Labeling Sustainability has developed a proprietary tool that allows the calculation of PCR-compliant
LCA results for Ready Mix Concrete product designs. The tool auto-calculates results by scaling base-
unit technosphere inputs (i.e.1 kg sand, 1 KWh electricity, etc.) to replicate the reference flow
conversions that take place in any typical LCA software like openLCA or SimaPro. The tool was tested
against several LCAs performed in openLCA and the tool generated identical results to those realized
in openLCA across every impact category and inventory metric (where comparisons could be readily
made).

Representativeness: The representativeness of the data is summarized as follows.

ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS AND INVENTORY METRICS —

Per the PCR, this EPD supports the life cycle impact assessment indicators and inventory metrics as
listed in the tables below. As specified in the PCR, the most recent US EPA Tool for the Reduction
and Assessment of Chemical and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI), impact categories were
utilized as they provide a North American context for the mandatory category indicators to be
included in the EPD. Additionally, the PCR requires a set of inventory metrics to be reported with the
LCIA indicators (see tables below).

Table 10: Definitions of life cycle impact categories and life cycle inventory metrics

Midpoint impact categories

Global Warming Potential
(GWP) (units: kg CO2-eq)

Global Warming Potential or climate change can be defined as the change
in global temperature caused by the greenhouse effect that the release of
greenhouse gases by human activity creates. The Environmental Profiles
characterization model is based on factors developed by the United
Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Factors are
expressed as Global Warming Potential over the time horizon of different
years, being the most common 100 years (GWP100), measured in the
reference unit, kg CO2 equivalent.

Ozone Depletion Potential
(ODP) (kg CFC-11-eq)

Ozone-depleting gases cause damage to stratospheric ozone or the ozone
layer. CFCSs, halons and HCFCSs are the major causes of ozone depletion.
The characterization model has been developed by the World
Meteorological Organization (WMO) and defines the ozone depletion
potential of different gases relative to the reference substance
chlorofluorocarbon-11 (CFC-11), expressed in kg CFC-11 equivalent.

Acidification Potential (AP)
(kg SO2-eq)

Acidic gases such as Sulphur dioxide (602) react with water in the
atmosphere to form acid rain, a process known as acid deposition.
Acidification potential is expressed using the reference unit, kg SO2
equivalent. The model does not take account of regional differences in
terms of which areas are more or Less susceptible to acidification. It
accounts only for acidification caused by SO2 and NOXx. This includes
acidification due to fertilizer use, according to the method developed by the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). CML has based the
characterization factor on the RAINS model developed by the University of
Amsterdam.

Eutrophication Potential (EP)
(PO4 3- -eq)

Eutrophication is the build-up of a concentration of chemical nutrients in an
ecosystem which leads to abnormal productivity. This causes excessive
plant growth like algae in rivers which causes severe reductions in water
quality and animal populations. This category is based on the work of
Heljungs, and is expressed using the reference unit, kg PO4 3- equivalents.
Direct and indirect impacts of fertilizers are included in the method. The
direct impacts are from production of the fertilizers and the indirect ones
are calculated using the IPCC method to estimate emissions to water
causing eutrophication.

Photochemical Ozone
Creation/Smog Potential
(POCP) (kg 03-eq)

Ozone is protective in the stratosphere, but on the ground-level, it is toxic to
humans in high concentration. Photochemical ozone, also called ground-
level ozone, is formed by the reaction of volatile organic compounds and
nitrogen oxides in the presence of heat and sunlight. The impact category
depends largely on the amounts of carbon monoxide (CO), Sulphur dioxide
(SO2), nitrogen oxide (NO), ammonium and NMVOC (non-methane volatile
organic compounds). Photochemical ozone creation potential (also known
as summer smogj for emission of substances to air is calculated with the
United Nations Economic Commission for 22 Europe (UNECE) trajectory
model (including fate) and expressed using the reference unit, kg ethylene
(C2H4) equivalent.

Abiotic Depletion Potential
(ADPel and ADPff) (kg Sb-eq)

ô LABELING SUSTAINABILITF

The main concern of this category is the health of humans and the
ecosystem and how it is affected by the extraction of minerals and fossil
fuels, which are inputs into the system. For each extraction of minerals and
fossil fuels, the abiotic depletion factor is determined. This indicator is on a
global scale and is based on the concentration reserves and rate of
deaccumulation. The results are presented in units of the reference
