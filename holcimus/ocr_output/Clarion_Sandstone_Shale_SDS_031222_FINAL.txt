SECTION 4: FIRST AID MEASURES

4.1. Description of First-aid Measures
General: Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. If you feel unwell, seek medical advice (show the label where
possible).
Inhalation: Remove to fresh air and keep at rest in a position comfortable for breathing. Encourage exposed person to cough, spit
out, and blow nose to remove dust. Immediately call a poison center or doctor/physician.
Skin Contact: Immediately remove contaminated clothing. Brush off loose particles from skin. Immediately flush skin with plenty of
water for at least 30 minutes. Get immediate medical advice/attention.
Eye Contact: Immediately rinse with water for at least 30 minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue
rinsing. Get immediate medical advice/attention.
Ingestion: Rinse mouth. Do NOT induce vomiting. Obtain emergency medical attention.
4.2. Most Important Symptoms and Effects Both Acute and Delayed
General: May cause respiratory irritation. Causes damage to organs (lung/respiratory system) through prolonged or repeated
exposure (Inhalation). May cause cancer by inhalation. Causes severe skin burns and eye damage.
Inhalation: irritation of the respiratory tract and the other mucous membranes. May be corrosive to the respiratory tract. Some
studies show that exposure to respirable crystalline silica (without silicosis) or that the disease silicosis may be associated with the
increased incidence of several autoimmune disorders such as scleroderma (thickening of the skin), systemic lupus erythematosus,
rheumatoid arthritis and diseases affecting the kidneys. Silicosis increases the risk of tuberculosis. Some studies show an increased
incidence of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease in workers exposed to respirable crystalline silica.
Skin Contact: Redness, pain, swelling, itching, burning, dryness, and dermatitis. Causes severe irritation which will progress to
chemical burns.
Eye Contact: Causes permanent damage to the cornea, iris, or conjunctiva.
Ingestion: May cause burns orirritation of the linings of the mouth, throat, and gastrointestinal tract.
Chronic Symptoms: Long term exposure to respirable crystalline silica results in a significant risk of developing silicosis and other
non-malignant respiratory disease, lung cancer, kidney effects, and immune system effects.
4.3. Indication of Any Immediate Medical Attention and Special Treatment Needed
If exposed or concerned, get medical advice and attention. If medical advice is needed, have product container or label at hand.

SECTION 10: STABILITY AND REACTIVITY

10.1. Reactivity:

Reacts slowly with water forming hydrated compounds, releasing heat and producing a strong alkaline

solution until reaction is substantially complete.

10.2. Chemical Stability:

Stable under recommended handling and storage conditions (see section 7).

10.3. Possibility of Hazardous Reactions:

Hazardous polymerization will not occur.

10.4. Conditions to Avoid:

Direct sunlight, extremely high or low temperatures, and incompatible materials.

10.5. Incompatible Materials:

Strong acids. Strong oxidizers.

10.6. Hazardous Decomposition Products:

Adding water produces (caustic) calcium, potassium and sodium hydroxide. Quartz (silica) will dissolve in hydroflouric acid producing
a corrosive gas, silicon tetrafluoride. Crystalline silica exists in several forms, the most common of which is quartz. If crystalline silica
(quartz) is heated to more than 870 °C (1598 °F), it can change to a form of crystalline silica known as trydimite, and if crystalline silica
(quartz) is heated to more than 1470 °C (2678 °F), it can change to a form of crystalline silica known as cristobalite. The OSHA PEL for
crystalline silica as trydimite and cristobalite is one-half of the OSHA PEL for crystalline silica (quartz). Thermal decomposition may
produce: Corrosive vapors. Calcium oxides. Carbon oxides (CO, COz2). Oxides of magnesium. Potassium oxides. Silicon oxides. Sulfur
oxides.
