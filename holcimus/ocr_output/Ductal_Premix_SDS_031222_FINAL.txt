Safety Data Sheet
According To Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 58 / Monday, March 26, 2012 / Rules And Regulations And According To The Hazardous Products Regulation (February 11, 2015).

Inhalation: When symptoms occur: go into open air and ventilate suspected area. Obtain medical attention if breathing difficulty
persists.

Skin Contact: Remove contaminated clothing. Immediately drench affected area with water for at least 15 minutes. If exposed or
concerned: Get medical advice/attention. Obtain medical attention if irritation/rash develops or persists.

Eye Contact: Immediately rinse with water for at least 30 minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue
rinsing. Get immediate medical advice/attention.

Ingestion: Rinse mouth. Do NOT induce vomiting. Obtain medical attention.

4.2. Most Important Symptoms and Effects Both Acute and Delayed

General: May cause respiratoryirritation. May cause cancer by inhalation. . Causes damage to organs (lung/respiratory system)
through prolonged or repeated exposure (Inhalation). Skin sensitization. Causes skin irritation. Causes serious eye damage.
Inhalation: Irritation of the respiratory tract and the other mucous membranes. Some studies show that exposure to respirable
crystalline silica (without silicosis) or that the disease silicosis may be associated with the increased incidence of several
autoimmune disorders such as scleroderma (thickening of the skin), systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and
diseases affecting the kidneys. Silicosis increases the risk of tuberculosis. Some studies show an increased incidence of chronic
kidney disease and end-stage renal disease in workers exposed to respirable crystalline silica.

Skin Contact: Redness, pain, swelling, itching, burning, dryness, and dermatitis. May cause an allergic skin reaction. May cause skin
to become dry or cracked.

Eye Contact: Causes permanent damage to the cornea, iris, or conjunctiva. Airborne dust may cause immediate or delayedirritation
or inflammation. Eye contact with large amounts of dry powder or with wet cement can cause moderate eyeirritation, chemical
burns and blindness. Eye exposures require immediate first aid and medical attention to prevent significant damage to the eye.
Ingestion: Ingestion may cause adverse effects.

Chronic Symptoms: Long term exposure to respirable crystalline silica results in a significant risk of developing silicosis and other
non-malignant respiratory disease, lung cancer, kidney effects, and immune system effects.

4.3. Indication of Any Immediate Medical Attention and Special Treatment Needed
If exposed or concerned, get medical advice and attention. If medical advice is needed, have product container or label at hand.

SECTION 5: FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES

5.1.  Extinguishing Media

Suitable Extinguishing Media: Water spray, dry chemical, foam, carbon dioxide.

Unsuitable Extinguishing Media: Do not use a heavy water stream. Use of heavy stream of water may spread fire.
5.2. Special Hazards Arising From the Substance or Mixture

Fire Hazard: Not considered flammable but may burn at high temperatures.

Explosion Hazard: Product is not explosive.

Reactivity: Hazardous reactions will not occur under normal conditions.

5.3. Advice for Firefighters

Precautionary Measures Fire: Exercise caution when fighting any chemical fire.

Firefighting Instructions: Use water spray or fog for cooling exposed containers.

Protection During Firefighting: Do not enter fire area without proper protective equipment, including respiratory protection.
Hazardous Combustion Products: Silicon oxides.

5.4. Reference to Other Sections

Refer to Section 9 for flammability properties.

SECTION 6: ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

6.1. Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures

General Measures: Do not handle until all safety precautions have been read and understood. Do not breathe dust. Do not get in
eyes, on skin, or on clothing.

6.1.1. For Non-Emergency Personnel

Protective Equipment: Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).

Emergency Procedures: Evacuate unnecessary personnel.

6.1.2. For Emergency Personnel

Protective Equipment: Equip cleanup crew with proper protection.

Emergency Procedures: Upon arrival at the scene, a first responder is expected to recognize the presence of dangerous goods,
protect oneself and the public, secure the area, and call for the assistance of trained personnel as soon as conditions permit.
Ventilate area.

SECTION 7: HANDLING AND STORAGE

7.1. Precautions for Safe Handling

Additional Hazards When Processed: Cutting, crushing, sanding or grinding of crystalline silica-bearing materials will release
respirable crystalline silica. Use all appropriate measures of dust control or suppression, and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
described in Section 8 below. Heavy material - proper lifting methods or equipment.

Precautions for Safe Handling: Obtain special instructions before use. Do not handle until all safety precautions have been read and
understood. Wash hands and other exposed areas with mild soap and water before eating, drinking or smoking and when leaving
work. Do not get in eyes, on skin, or on clothing. Do not breathe dust.

Hygiene Measures: Handle in accordance with good industrial hygiene and safety procedures.

7.2. Conditions for Safe Storage, Including Any Incompatibilities

Incompatible Materials: Acids, ammonium salts and aluminum metal. Cement dissolves in hydrofluoric acid, producing corrosive
silicon tetrafluoride gas. Cement reacts with water to form silicates and calcium hydroxide. Silicates react with powerful oxidizers
such as fluorine, boron trifluoride, chlorine trifluoride, manganese trifluoride, and oxygen difluoride.

7.3. Specific End Use(s)

Ductal® Premix is an ultra-high performance material used to produce a specialized concrete used in construction. Metallic fibers
