SECTION 4: FIRST AID MEASURES

4.1. Description of First-aid Measures

General: Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. If you feel unwell, seek medical advice (show the label where
possible).

Inhalation: When symptoms occur: go into open air and ventilate suspected area. Obtain medical attention if breathing difficulty
persists.

Skin Contact: Remove contaminated clothing. Immediately drench affected area with water for at least 15 minutes. If exposed or
concerned: Get medical advice/attention. Seek medical attention for thermal burns.

Eye Contact: Rinse cautiously with water for at least 15 minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue rinsing.
Obtain medical attention if irritation develops or persists.
Ingestion: Rinse mouth. Do NOT induce vomiting. Obtain medical attention.
4.2. Most Important Symptoms and Effects Both Acute and Delayed
General: May cause cancer. Causes damage to organs through prolonged or repeated exposure. Risk of thermal burns on contact
with molten product. Causes skin irritation.
Inhalation: Toxic fumes may be generated from heating asphalt and may be harmful if inhaled. WARNING: irritating and toxic
hydrogen sulfide gas may be present. Greater than 15-20ppm continuous exposure can cause mucous membrane and respiratory
tract irritation. 50-500 ppm can cause headache, nausea, and dizziness. Continued exposure at these levels can lead to loss of
reasoning and balance, difficulty in breathing, fluid in the lungs, and possible loss of consciousness. Greater than 500ppm can cause
rapid unconsciousness and death if not promptly revived. Prolonged exposure may cause irritation. Repeated or prolonged exposure
to respirable (airborne) crystalline silica dust will cause lung damage in the form of silicosis. Symptoms will include progressively
more difficult breathing, cough, fever, and weight loss.
Skin Contact: Redness, pain, swelling, itching, burning, dryness, and dermatitis. May cause thermal burns.
Eye Contact: May cause slight irritation to eyes. May cause thermal burns.
Ingestion: Ingestion may cause adverse effects.
Chronic Symptoms: May cause cancer. Causes damage to organs through prolonged or repeated exposure.
4.3. Indication of Any Immediate Medical Attention and Special Treatment Needed
If exposed or concerned, get medical advice and attention. If medical advice is needed, have product container or label at hand.

SECTION 5: FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES

5.1.  Extinguishing Media

Suitable Extinguishing Media: Water spray, dry chemical, foam, carbon dioxide.

Unsuitable Extinguishing Media: Do not use a heavy water stream. Use of heavy stream of water may spread fire.
5.2. Special Hazards Arising From the Substance or Mixture

Fire Hazard: Not considered flammable but may burn at high temperatures.

Explosion Hazard: Product is not explosive.

Other Information: Do not allow run-off from fire fighting to enter drains or water courses.
5.4. Reference to Other Sections
Refer to Section 9 for flammability properties.

SECTION 6: ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

6.1. Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures
General Measures: Do not handle until all safety precautions have been read and understood. Do not get in eyes, on skin, or on
clothing. Do not breathe dust.

6.1.1. For Non-Emergency Personnel
Protective Equipment: Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).
Emergency Procedures: Evacuate unnecessaryÿ personnel.

6.1.2. For Emergency Personnel
Protective Equipment: Equip cleanup crew with proper protection.
Emergency Procedures: Upon arrival at the scene, a first responder is expected to recognize the presence of dangerous goods,
protect oneself and the public, secure the area, and call for the assistance of trained personnel as soon as conditions permit.
Ventilate area.

6.2. Environmental Precautions

Avoid release to the environment. Prevent entry to sewers and public waters.

6.3. Methods and Materials for Containment and Cleaning Up
For Containment: Contain solid spills with appropriate barriers and prevent migration and entry into sewers or streams.
Methods for Cleaning Up: Clean up spills immediately and dispose of waste safely. Recover the product by vacuuming, shoveling or
sweeping. Transfer spilled material to a suitable container for disposal. Contact competent authorities after a spill. Vacuum clean-up
is preferred. If sweeping is required use a dust suppressant.

6.4. Reference to Other Sections
See Section 8 for exposure controls and personal protection and Section 13 for disposal considerations.

SECTION 7: HANDLING AND STORAGE

7.1. Precautions for Safe Handling
Additional Hazards When Processed: Cutting, crushing, sanding or grinding of crystalline silica-bearing materials will release
respirable crystalline silica. Use all appropriate measures of dust control or suppression, and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
described in Section 8 below. Heavy material - proper lifting methods or equipment. Hydrogen sulfide is a highly flammable,
explosive gas under certain conditions, is a toxic gas, and may be fatal. Gas can accumulate in the headspace of closed containers,
use caution when opening sealed containers. Heating the product or containers can cause thermal decomposition of the product
and release hydrogen sulfide.
Precautions for Safe Handling: Obtain special instructions before use. Do not handle until all safety precautions have been read and
understood. Do not breathe dust. Avoid contact with eyes, skin and clothing. Wash hands and other exposed areas with mild soap
and water before eating, drinking or smoking and when leaving work.
Hygiene Measures: Handle in accordance with good industrial hygiene and safety procedures.

7.2. Conditions for Safe Storage, Including Any Incompatibilities
Technical Measures: Comply with applicable regulations.
Storage Conditions: Keep container closed when not in use. Store in a dry, cool place. Keep/Store away from direct sunlight,
extremely high or low temperatures and incompatible materials. Store locked up/in a secure area.
Incompatible Materials: Strong acids, strong bases, strong oxidizers. Fluorine.
Storage Temperature: Unlimited

7.3. Specific End Use(s)
