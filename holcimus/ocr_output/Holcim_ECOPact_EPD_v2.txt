CUT-OFF PRIMARY SOURCES OF LCI DATA

Items excluded from system boundary include: production,
manufacture, and construction of manufacturing capital
goods and infrastructure; production and manufacture of
production equipment, delivery vehicles, and laboratory
equipment, personnel-related activities (travel, furniture, and
office supplies); and energy and water use related to company
management and sales activities that may be located either
within the factory site or at another location.

ALLOCATION PROCEDURE

Allocation follows the requirements and guidance of ISO
14044.

The product category rules for this EPD recognize fly ash, silica
fume and slag as waste products recovered materials and thus
the environmental impacts allocated to these materials are
limited to the treatment and transportation required to use as
a concrete material input.

* Emerging LCA impact categories and inventory items are still under development and can have high levels of uncertainty that preclude international
acceptance pending further development. Use caution when interpreting data in these categories.

- Not all LCA datasets for upstream materials include these impact categories and thus results may be incomplete. Use caution when interpreting data in
these categories

EPDs are comparable only if they comply with ISO 21930 (2017), use the same, sub-category PCR where applicable, include all
relevant information modules and are based on equivalent scenarios with respect to the context of construction works.
