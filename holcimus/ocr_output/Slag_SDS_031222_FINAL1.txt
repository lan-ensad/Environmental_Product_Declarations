SECTION 4: FIRST AID MEASURES

4.1. Description of First-aid Measures
General: Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. If you feel unwell, seek medical advice (show the label where
possible).
Inhalation: When symptoms occur: go into open air and ventilate suspected area. Obtain medical attention if breathing difficulty
persists.
Skin Contact: Remove contaminated clothing. Immediately drench affected area with water for at least 15 minutes. If exposed or
concerned: Get medical advice/attention.
Eye Contact: Immediately rinse with water for at least 30 minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue
rinsing. Get immediate medical advice/attention.
Ingestion: Rinse mouth. Do NOT induce vomiting. Obtain medical attention.
4.2. Most Important Symptoms and Effects Both Acute and Delayed
General: Causes serious eye damage. May cause respiratoryirritation. Causes skin irritation. May cause cancer by inhalation.
Inhalation: irritation of the respiratory tract and the other mucous membranes. Some studies show that exposure to respirable
crystalline silica (without silicosis) or that the disease silicosis may be associated with the increased incidence of several
autoimmune disorders such as scleroderma (thickening of the skin), systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and
diseases affecting the kidneys. Silicosis increases the risk of tuberculosis. Some studies show an increased incidence of chronic
kidney disease and end-stage renal disease in workers exposed to respirable crystalline silica.
Skin Contact: Slag may cause dry skin, discomfort, irritation, and dermatitis. Slag is capable of causing dermatitis by irritation and
allergy. Skin affected by dermatitis may include symptoms such as, redness, itching, rash, scaling, and cracking. Irritant dermatitis is
caused by the physical properties of slag including moisture and abrasion. Allergic contact dermatitis is caused by sensitization to
hexavalent chromium (chromate) present in slag. The reaction can range from a mild rash to severe skin ulcers. Persons already
sensitized may react to the first contact with slag. Others may develop allergic dermatitis after years of repeated contact with slag.
Eye Contact: Airborne dust may cause immediate or delayed irritation or inflammation. Eye contact with large amounts of dry
powder or with wet slag can cause moderate eyeirritation. Eye exposures require immediate first aid to prevent significant damage
to the eye.
Ingestion: Ingestion may cause adverse effects.
Chronic Symptoms: Long term exposure to respirable crystalline silica results in a significant risk of developing silicosis and other
non-malignant respiratory disease, lung cancer, kidney effects, and immune system effects.
4.3. Indication of Any Immediate Medical Attention and Special Treatment Needed
If exposed or concerned, get medical advice and attention. If medical advice is needed, have product container or label at hand.
SECTION 5: FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES
5.1.  Extinguishing Media
Suitable Extinguishing Media: Use extinguishing media appropriate for surrounding fire.
Unsuitable Extinguishing Media: Do not use a heavy water stream. Use of heavy stream of water may spread fire.
5.2. Special Hazards Arising From the Substance or Mixture
Fire Hazard: Not flammable.
Explosion Hazard: Product is not explosive.
Reactivity: Hazardous reactions will not occur under normal conditions.
5.3. Advice for Firefighters
Precautionary Measures Fire: Exercise caution when fighting any chemical fire.
Firefighting Instructions: Do not get water inside containers. Do not apply water stream directly at source of leak. Use water spray
or fog for cooling exposed containers.
Protection During Firefighting: Do not enter fire area without proper protective equipment, including respiratory protection.
Hazardous Combustion Products: Calcium oxides. Metal oxides. Silicon oxides.
Other Information: Do not allow run-off from fire fighting to enter drains or water courses.
