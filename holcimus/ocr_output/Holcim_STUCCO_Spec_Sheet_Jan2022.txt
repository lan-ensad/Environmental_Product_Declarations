5. Installation

Preparatory Work

Custom Stucco Cement should be mixed according to
ASTM C926. Machine mixing is highly recommended. Mixing
instructions are printed on each bag and shown below:

# Use 1 bag Custom Stucco to the appropriate aggregate
volume listed in Table 2 or 3 in ASTM C926; use sand
conforming to ASTM C897

# First add approximately 3/4 of the desired volume of
mix water, then add 1/2 the sand and then 1 bag of
Custom Stucco to the mixer

# Finally, add the rest of the sand and remaining mix
water sufficient to achieve the desired field workablity
and uniform color

# The combined materials should mixed for 3-5 minutes
after all materials are in the mixer

Precautions
Performance

Inadequate mixing will reduce the quality of stucco
Re-tempering should be done only once

# Stucco should be discarded after 1-12 hours from
initial mixing if it has not been used

skin with water as soon as possible. Exposure of sufficient
