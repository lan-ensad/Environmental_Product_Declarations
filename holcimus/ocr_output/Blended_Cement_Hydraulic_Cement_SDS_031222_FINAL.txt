General: May cause respiratory irritation. Skin sensitization. Causes skin irritation. Causes serious eye damage. Causes damage to
organs (lung/respiratory system) through prolonged or repeated exposure (Inhalation). May cause cancer by inhalation.
Inhalation: irritation of the respiratory tract and the other mucous membranes. Some studies show that exposure to respirable
crystalline silica (without silicosis) or that the disease silicosis may be associated with the increased incidence of several
autoimmune disorders such as scleroderma (thickening of the skin), systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and
diseases affecting the kidneys. Silicosis increases the risk of tuberculosis. Some studies show an increased incidence of chronic
kidney disease and end-stage renal disease in workers exposed to respirable crystalline silica.
Skin Contact: Redness, pain, swelling, itching, burning, dryness, and dermatitis. May cause an allergic skin reaction. May cause skin

repeated exposure (Inhalation).

Reproductive Toxicity: Not classified

Specific Target Organ Toxicity (Single Exposure): May cause respiratoryirritation.

Aspiration Hazard: Not classified

Symptoms/Injuries After Inhalation: Irritation of the respiratory tract and the other mucous membranes. Some studies show that
exposure to respirable crystalline silica (without silicosis) or that the disease silicosis may be associated with the increased incidence
of several autoimmune disorders such as scleroderma (thickening of the skin), systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis
and diseases affecting the kidneys. Silicosis increases the risk of tuberculosis. Some studies show an increased incidence of chronic
kidney disease and end-stage renal disease in workers exposed to respirable crystalline silica.

Symptoms/Injuries After Skin Contact: Redness, pain, swelling, itching, burning, dryness, and dermatitis. May cause an allergic skin
reaction. May cause skin to become dry or cracked.

Symptoms/Injuries After Eye Contact: Causes permanent damage to the cornea, iris, or conjunctiva. Airborne dust may cause
immediate or delayedirritation or inflammation. Eye contact with large amounts of dry powder or with wet cement can cause
