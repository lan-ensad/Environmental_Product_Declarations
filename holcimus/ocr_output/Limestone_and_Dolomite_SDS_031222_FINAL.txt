4.1. Description of First-aid Measures

General: Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. If you feel unwell, seek medical advice (show the label where
possible).

Inhalation: When symptoms occur: go into open air and ventilate suspected area. Obtain medical attention if breathing difficulty
persists.

Skin Contact: Remove contaminated clothing. Drench affected area with water for at least 15 minutes. If exposed or concerned: Get
medical advice/attention.

Eye Contact: Rinse cautiously with water for at least 5 minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue rinsing.
Obtain medical attention if irritation develops or persists.

Ingestion: Rinse mouth. Do NOT induce vomiting. Obtain medical attention.

4.2. Most Important Symptoms and Effects Both Acute and Delayed

General: Causes damage to organs (lung/respiratory system) through prolonged or repeated exposure (Inhalation). May cause
cancer by inhalation.

Inhalation: Some studies show that exposure to respirable crystalline silica (without silicosis) or that the disease silicosis may be
associated with the increased incidence of several autoimmune disorders such as scleroderma (thickening of the skin), systemic
lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and diseases affecting the kidneys. Silicosis increases the risk of tuberculosis. Some
studies show an increased incidence of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease in workers exposed to respirable
crystalline silica. Prolonged exposure may causeirritation.

SECTION 7: HANDLING AND STORAGE

7.1. Precautions for Safe Handling

Additional Hazards When Processed: Stack bagged material in a secure manner to prevent falling. Bagged aggregate is heavy and
poses risks such as sprains and strains to the back, arms, shoulders and legs during lifting and mixing. Handle with care and use
appropriate control measures. Engulfment hazard. To prevent burial or suffocation, do not enter a confined space, such as a silo,
bin, bulk truck, or other storage container or vessel that stores or contains Limestone and Dolomite. Dust can buildup or adhere to
the walls of a confined space. The dust can release, collapse or fall unexpectedly. Do not stand on stockpiles of Limestone and
Dolomite, they may be unstable. Use engineering controls (e.g. wetting stockpiles) to prevent windblown dust from stockpiles,
which may cause the hazards described in Section 2. This product is NOT to be used for abrasive blasting. Cutting, crushing or
grinding Limestone and Dolomite, hardened cement, concrete or other crystalline silica-bearing materials will release respirable
crystalline silica. Use all appropriate measures of dust control or suppression, and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) described in
Section 8 below. Repeated or prolonged exposure to respirable (airborne) crystalline silica dust will cause lung damage in the form
of silicosis. Symptoms will include progressively more difficult breathing, cough, fever, and weight loss.

Precautions for Safe Handling: Obtain special instructions before use. Do not handle until all safety precautions have been read and
understood. Wash hands and other exposed areas with mild soap and water before eating, drinking or smoking and when leaving
work. Do not breathe dust. Avoid contact with eyes, skin and clothing.

Hygiene Measures: Handle in accordance with good industrial hygiene and safety procedures.

7.2. Conditions for Safe Storage, Including Any Incompatibilities

Technical Measures: Comply with applicable regulations.

Storage Conditions: Keep container closed when not in use. Store in a dry, cool place. Keep/Store away from direct sunlight,
extremely high or low temperatures and incompatible materials. Store locked up/in a secure area.

Incompatible Materials: Hydrofluoric acid. Strong oxidizers.

Storage Temperature: Unlimited

7.3. Specific End Use(s)

Limestone and Dolomite are used in the manufacture of bricks, mortar, cement, concrete, plasters, paving materials, and other
construction applications. Limestone and Dolomite are distributed in bags, totes and bulk shipment. Do NOT use this product for
abrasive blasting. This Safety Data Sheet and the information contained herein were not developed for abrasive blasting.
