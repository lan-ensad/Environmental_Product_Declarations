ECOPact Specification Language

ECOPactis the industry’s broadest range oflow-carbon concrete
for high-performing and sustainable construction. ECOPact features a
range of low-carbon levels, from 30% to 100% less carbon emissions
compared to standard (OPC) concrete. ECOPact can be used in any type of
applications, regardless of performance requirements: from foundations,
columns and beams, to walls, driveways and walkways. ECOPact is
available in a variety of strength classes and is compliant with industry
standards. It can be handled, pumped and finished like conventional
concrete.

In accordance with the sustainability targets of your project, the
engineer can either specify a desired percentage of Global Warming
Potential (GWP) reduction compared to a regional baseline, or indicate a
maximum GWP value per class of concrete mix. As a solutions provider, our
concrete experts can help find out the GWP targets that can be achieved for
any given strength and durability requirement.

The GWP value of each ECOPact mix is scientifically calculated and
third-party verified. The outcome is summarized in a product specific
Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) that is part of the ECOPact
solution and will be provided with each mix.

This specification language can be included into the project
specifications. Below is the typical list of contents in Specifications for Cast-
in-place concrete. ECOPact specification language should be inserted in the
sections identified in green bold font. These sections are pertinent to low-
carbon concrete.

This specification is provided as a courtesy on an as-is basis, and is
not intended to substitute for specific design services provided by an
architect, engineer, or other design professional. Text underlined and/or red
in color must be addressed to complete a final specification document. It is
the sole responsibility of the editor to exercise appropriate care and sound
professional judgment in the execution of this task.

1.9 CONCRETE MIXTURES, GENERAL

These specification inserts are performance based. This allows the concrete manufacturer to optimize
each ECOPact mix design in order to reach the required strength and durability requirements. At the same
time the use of raw materials will be optimized, thus leading to maximal GWP reduction. The engineer should
minimize prescriptive requirements on concrete mixtures and construction means and methods and increase

the focus on measurable performance attributes when appropriate. The inclusion of both prescriptive and
performance requirements in the specification can lead to inherent confilicts.

1.9.1 DESIGN & TESTING

Basis-of-Design Product: Subject to compliance with requirements, provide Holcim (US); ECOPact or
comparable product.

Prepare design mixtures for each type and strength of concrete, proportioned on the basis of laboratory
trial mixture or field test data, or both, according to ACI 301.

1.9.2 CEMENTITIOUS MATERIALS

In order to best leverage the available regional SCM and optimize the embodied carbon content of
ECOPact mixes, it is preferable not to limit the percentage ofcementitious materials other than Portland cement
(Option 1). However, if there is a particular project requirement, use Option 2 limits to allow for the entire
ECOPact range of low-carbon mixes.

Option 1 (Preferred): Do not limit percentage of cementitious materials other than Portland cement
unless there is a particular requirement in local building codes.

Option 2: Limit percentage, by weight, of cementitious materials other than Portland cement in concrete
as follows:

1. Fly Ash or Other Pozzolans: 50 percent by mass.

2. Slag Cement: 80 percent by mass.

3. Silica Fume: 15 percent by mass.

4. Total of Fly Ash or Other Pozzolans, Slag Cement, and Silica Fume: 70 percent by mass, with fly
ash or pozzolans not exceeding 50 percent by mass and silica fume not exceeding 10 percent by
mass.

5. Total of Fly Ash or Other Pozzolans and Silica Fume: 60 percent by mass with fly ash or
pozzolans not exceeding 50 percent by mass and silica fume not exceeding 10 percent by mass.

1.9.3 ADMIXTURES

1.10 CONCRETE MIXTURES

Maximum GWP allowances per mix can be addressed by two different approaches:

Option 1: Require a reduction percentage for the total GWP of the project's concrete mixes,
compared to the regional industry average based on NRMCA table

Option 2: Limit the GWP of each mix to a given value. This value can be derived from a whole-
building Life Cycle Analysis depending on the GWP reduction targets of the project, or by comparison
with standard mixes with equivalent strength and properties.

1.10.1 Maximum global warming potential (GWP):

OPTION 1: GWP reduction compared to NRMCA regional industry averages

Total GWP of the concrete supplied for the building shall be at least /insert%] % lower on a
volume-weighted basis, than the amount of GWP using NRMCA industry averages based on
strength and weight class for each mix. GWP reduction shall be validated through product-specific
Environmental Product Declarations for each mix.

Acceptable product: ECOPact by Holcim (US); or comparable product.

The aggregate reduction is calculated as follows:

GWP, mix * Vi
Reduction = 100% — 2 GWPamix * Vmix * 100%
D GW Pp mix * Vonix
