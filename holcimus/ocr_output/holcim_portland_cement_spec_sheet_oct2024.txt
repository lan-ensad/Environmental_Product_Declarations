3. Product Description

Usage

Portland cement is a building material that can be
used in a wide variety of concrete construction, including
commercial and architectural applications. Concrete
made with portland cement using proper mix design and
construction practices can be durable and resistant to the
impact of harsh environmental influences, such as freezing
and thawing, exposure to de-icing chemicals, chloride
ingress, and sulfate attack.

Portland cement is produced to meet ASTM C150 and
AASHTO M 85 for one or more of the designation types
(I-V) and may additionally meet optional requirements as
presented in the product specific Material Certification
Report.

Uses include:

Bridges # Precast
# Cast-in-place # Pre-stress or post-tension
# Concrete Masonry Units = Ready-mix
(CMU) ” Roads
# Drains # Soil Stabilization
= Grout = Tilt-up
s Masonry s Watertanks
= Pipe
Packaging

Portland cement is regionally available and can be supplied
in bulk quantities or may be regionally available in bags.

Composition and Materials

The primary ingredients of portland cement are calcium
silicate based clinker and gypsum ground to a fine
powder that, when mixed with water, sets and hardens. The
hydration of calcium silicates forms a fiber-like material
called calcium silicate hydrate (CSH).

AU manufacturing is quality controlled to ensure product
conformance.

Benefits

Portland cement is a versatile building material that is
suitable for a variety of concrete construction applications.
To achieve these and other special properties, particular
care is needed when proportioning, batching, placing,
finishing and curing concrete containing these products.

Limitations

There are many variables that affect concrete performance
beyond the control of the cement manufacturer. Good
concreting practices are required in orderto achieve desired
results. Attention must be given to formwork, batching,
mixing, placing, finishing and curing.In specialapplications,
selection of aggregates, admixtures and additives may
need to be scrutinized. Holcim (US) Inc. recommends that
all concrete mix proportions be evaluated for acceptable
performance prior to use.

4. Technical Data

Applicable Standards
Produced in accordance with:

# ASTM C150 Standard Specification for Portland Cement
s AASHTO M 85 Standard Specification for Portland
Cement

Physical / Chemical Properties

Portland cements are manufactured to conform to all
applicable requirements for the designated type of ASTM
C150 and AASHTO M 85.

5. Installation

Requirements

For installation, consult specific project requirements or
applicable specifications and guides as available from
the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM),
American Concrete Institute (ACI),, or other reputable
industry organization.

Preparatory Work

Deliver products in manufacturer's original, unopened,
undamaged, containers with identification labels intact.
Store materials protected from exposure to harmful
environmental conditions and at temperatures and
humidity conditions recommended by the manufacturer.

Verify that site conditions are acceptable for installation. Do
not proceed with installation until unacceptable conditions
are corrected.

Methods

Concrete is a material that includes several constituents
such as cement, aggregate (usually sand and gravel), water,
and admixtures. Freshly mixed concrete should generally
be plastic or semi-fluid and moldable.

Good concreting practices are required for durable and
strong concrete. Proper proportioning, batching, mixing,
placing, consolidating, finishing and curing, as well as
proper subgrade preparation, formwork, uniform slump,
special techniques and other steps are all critical to
achieving the desired results.

The character of concrete is largely determined by the
water-cement ratio (w/c), and is especially critical to a
durable, strong concrete. Freshly mixed (plastic) and
hardened properties of concrete can be enhanced by
adding supplementary cementitious materials (SCM's)
or admixtures during batching. Admixtures may be used
to adjust setting time and/or hardening, reduce water
demand, increase workability, entrain air, improve cost-
effectiveness or other properties.

Safety Precautions

Refer to the applicable Safety Data Sheet (SDS), which
should be consulted prior to the use of this product. These
SDS's are available at www.holcim.us.

Avoid direct contact with the skin. If contact occurs, wash
skin with water as soon as possible. Exposure of sufficient
duration to cement can cause serious and potentially
irreversible tissue destruction in the form of chemical
burns. If cement gets into the eyes, immediately flush eyes
thoroughly with water and seek medical attention. Proper
PPE is always required.
