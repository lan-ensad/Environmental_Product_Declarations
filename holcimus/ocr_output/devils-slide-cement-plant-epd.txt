Product Definition Portland cement is defined as a hydraulic cement produced by pulverizing
clinker, consisting essentially of crystalline hydraulic calcium silicates, and
usually containing one or more of the following: water, calcium sulfate, up to
5% limestone, and processing additions (NSF PCR 2020, ASTM C150, ASTM
C219).

Blended cement is a hydraulic cement consisting of two or more inorganic
constituents (at least one of which is not Portland cement or Portland cement
clinker) which separately or in combination contribute to the strength gaining
properties of the cement, (made with or without other constituents, processing
additions and functional additions, by intergrinding or other blending).

e Type IL (ASTM C595) — is a Portland-limestone cement and is a
hydraulic cement in which the limestone content is more than 5 % but
less than or equal to 15 % by mass of the blended cement.

e Type IP (ASTM C595) —Portland-pozzolan cement shall be a
hydraulic cement in which the pozzolan constituent is up to 40 % by
mass of the blended cement.

Product Description

This EPD reports environmental transparency information for five cement types produced by Holcim at its Devil's
Slide, UT plant. Cements are hydraulic binders and are manufactured by grinding cement clinker and other main or
minor constituents into a finely ground, usually grey colored mineral powder. When mixed with water, cement acts as
a glue to bind together the sand, gravel or crushed stone to form concrete, one of the most durable, resilient and
widely used construction materials in the world. The Table below sets out each cement type constituents and
applicable standards. All Devils Slide cements are sold in bulk.

e Production and manufacture of production equipment, delivery vehicles, and laboratory equipment
e  Personnel-related activities (travel, furniture, and office supplies)
e Energy and water use related to company management and sales activities that may be located either within

Cut-off Criteria

The cut-off criteria as per NSF PCR, Section 7.1.8 [2] and ISO 21930, 7.1.8 [3] were followed. Per ISO 21930, 7.1.8
[3], all input/output data required were collected and included in the LCI modelling. No substances with hazardous
and toxic properties that pose a concern for human health and/or the environment were identified in the framework of
this EPD. Any plant specific data gaps for the reference year 2019 e.g., amounts of lubricants and refractory were
filled in with industry data (secondary data).

Data Collection
Gate-to-gate input/output flow data were collected for the following processes for the reference year 2019:
e _Limestone quarry, clinker production and cement manufacture — Devils Slide, UT.

Allocation Rules

Allocation follows the requirements and guidance of ISO 14044 Clause 4.3.4 [5], NSF PCR [2], and ISO 21930
section 7.2 [3]. Recycling and recycled content are modeled using the cut-off rule. The sub-category PCR recognizes
fly ash, furnace bottom ash, bypass dust, mill scale, polluted soils, spent catalyst, aluminum oxide waste, silica fume,
granulated blast furnace slag, iron rich waste, cement kiln dust (CKD), flue gas desulfurization (FGD) gypsum, and
calcium fluoride rich waste as recovered materials and thus the environmental impacts allocated to these materials
are limited to the treatment and transportation required to use as a cement material input. Further, used tires,
plastics, solvents, used oil and oily waste, coal/carbon waste, roofing asphalt, household refuse-derived waste and
non-hazardous liquid waste are considered non-renewable and/or renewable secondary fuels. Only the materials,
water, energy, emissions, and other elemental flows associated with reprocessing, handling, sorting and
transportation from the point of the generating industrial process to their use in the production process are
considered. All emissions from combustion at the point of use are considered.

All relevant, specific processes, including inputs (raw materials, energy and ancillary materials) and outputs
(emissions and production volume) were considered and modeled to complete production profile for cement
products.

Completeness The relevant background materials and processes were taken from the US LCI Database (adjusted for

known data placeholders), ecoinvent V3.6 LCI database for US, and modeled in SimaPro software v.9.1.1.1,
September 2020. The completeness of the cradle-to-gate process chain in terms of process steps is
rigorously assessed for all cement product systems

To ensure consistency, the LCI modeling of the production input and output LCI data for the cement products
of interest used the same LCI modeling structure, which consisted of input material and intermediate
products, ancillary and packaging materials (if applicable), energy flows, water resource inputs, product

Consistency outputs, co-products, by-products, emissions to air, water and soil, and solid and liquid waste disposal.
Crosschecks concerning the plausibility of mass and energy flows were continuously conducted. The LCA
team conducted mass and energy balances at the facility level and selected process levels to maintain a
high level of consistency.

Internal reproducibility is possible since the data and the models are stored and available in LH Devils Slide
Athena LCI database developed in SimaPro, 2020. A high level of transparency is provided throughout the
Reproducibility report as the LCI profile is presented for each of the declared products as well as major upstream inputs.
Key primary (manufacturer specific) and secondary (generic) LCI data sources are also summarized in the
background report. External reproducibility is not possible as the background report is confidential.

Transparency Activity and LCI datasets are disclosed in the project report, including all data sources.

A sensitivity check was conducted to assess the reliability of the EPD results and conclusions by determining
Uncertainty how they are affected by uncertainties in the data or assumptions on calculation of LCIA and energy indicator
results.

Life Cycle Impact Assessment Results: Devil’s Slide, UT Cements

This section summarizes the production stage life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) results including resource use and
waste generated metrics based on the cradle-to-gate life cycle inventory inputs and outputs analysis. The results are
calculated based on 1 metric ton of each cement type as produced at the Devils Slide, UT plant. /t should be noted
that LCIA results are relative expressions and do not predict impacts on category endpoints, the exceeding of
thresholds, safety margins or risks [4], [5]. Further, a number of LCA impact categories and inventory items are still
emerging or under development and can have high levels of uncertainty that preclude international acceptance
pending further development. Use caution when interpreting results for these categories — identified with an “*” [2].

Only EPDSs prepared from cradle-to-grave life-cycle results and based on the same function, quantified by the same
functional unit, and taking account of replacement based on the product reference service life (RSL) relative to an
assumed building service life, can be used to assist purchasers and users in making informed comparisons between
products [2]. Environmental declarations from different programs may not be comparable [7]. EPDs are comparable
only if they comply with ISO 21930, use the same, sub-category PCR where applicable, include all relevant
information modules and are based on equivalent scenarios with respect to the context of construction works [3].

Sustainability Initiative (CSI) [15].

LCA Interpretation

The Manufacturing module (A3) drives most of the potential environmental impacts. Manufacturing impacts are
primarily driven by energy use (electricity and thermal fuels) used during the pyroprocessing of limestone in the
production of clinker. Clinker content in cement similarly defines the relative environmental profile of the final cement
product. Raw material extraction (A1) is the second largest contributor to the Production stage EPD results, followed
by the transportation (A2).

Additional Environmental Information

Committed to sustainability, the Devil’s Slide plant co-processes waste by recovering energy from recovered plastics
and tires to replace some of the fossil fuels and mineral resources used in cement processing.

Environmental Protection and Equipment

Holcim (US) manufacturing facilities comply with the U.S. environmental protection agency (EPA) regulations,
monitor and report the emissions to air during the manufacturing process as per the following:

- EPCRA Section 313 Toxic Release Inventory reporting (U.S) https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-
program, accessed 12-2020.

Air pollution abatement equipment used at Holcim’s Devils Slide plant consist of high and low temperature
baghouses, dry filters, cartridge filters and bin vents.
