3. Product Description

Basic Use

MaxCem® Type IS portland blast-furnace
slag cement which contains some portion
of pre-consumer recycled materials, is
manufactured to maximize eco-efficiency.
Portland blast-furnace slag cement is
a hydraulic cement in which the slag
constituent is up to 95% by mass of the
blended cement. Use of these materials
may contribute to achieving points or
credits in LEED® or other green building
assessment systems.

MaxCem® Type IS portland blast-furnace slag cement
is a building material which is used in a wide variety of
commercial and architectural applications. Concrete made
with MaxCem® Type IS portland blast-furnace slag cement
using proper mix design can be resistant to the impact of
harsh environmental influences, such as frost and de-icing
chemicals.

Uses include:

Bridges # Precast
# Cast-in-place # Pre-stress or post-tension
# Concrete Masonry Units = Ready-mix
(CMU) ” Roads
# Drains # Soil Stabilization
= Grout = Tilt-up
s Masonry s Watertanks
= Pipe
Packaging

MaxCem® Type IS portland blast-furnace slag cement is
regionally available and can be supplied in bulk quantities.

Composition and Materials

The primary ingredients of MaxCem® Type IS portland
blast-furnace slag cement are portland cement or clinker,
granulated blast-furnace slag (GBFS), and gypsum ground
to a fine powder that, when mixed with water, sets and
hardens. The hydration of calcium silicates forms a fiber-
like material called calcium silicate hydrate (CSH).

AU manufacturing is quality controlled to ensure product
conformance.

Types

MaxCem® Type IS portland blast-furnace slag cement
produced to meet the requirements of ASTM C595 (Type
IS) and AASHTO M 240 (Type IS) for portland blast-furnace
slag cement.

Benefits
# Meets the requirements of ASTM C595
s Meets the requirements of AASHTO M 240

Limitations

There are many variables that affect concrete performance
beyond the control of the cement manufacturer. Good
concreting practices are required in order to achieve desired
results. Attention must be given to formwork, batching,
mixing, placing, finishing and curing.In special applications,
selection of aggregates, admixtures and additives may
need to be scrutinized. Holcim (US) Inc. recommends that
all concrete mix proportions be evaluated for acceptable
performance prior to use.

conform to all applicable requirements for the designated
type of ASTM C595 and AASHTO M 240.

5. Installation

Requirements

For installation, consult specific project requirements or
applicable specifications and guides as available from
the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM),
American Concrete Institute (ACI),, or other reputable
industry organization.

Preparatory Work

Deliver products in manufacturer's original, unopened,
undamaged, containers with identification labels intact.
Store materials protected from exposure to harmful
environmental conditions and at temperatures and
humidity conditions recommended by the manufacturer.

Verify that site conditions are acceptable for installation. Do
not proceed with installation until unacceptable conditions
are corrected.

Methods

Concrete is a material that includes several constituents
such as cement, aggregate (usually sand and gravel), water,
and admixtures. Freshly mixed concrete should generally
be plastic or semi-fluid and moldable.

Good concreting practices are required for durable and
strong concrete. Proper proportioning, batching, mixing,
placing, consolidating, finishing and curing, as well as
proper subgrade preparation, formwork, uniform slump,
special techniques and other steps are all critical to
achieving the desired results.

The character of concrete is largely determined by the
water-cement ratio (w/c), and is especially critical to a
durable, strong concrete. Freshly mixed (plastic) and
hardened properties of concrete can be enhanced by
adding supplementary cementitious materials (SCM's)
or admixtures during batching. Admixtures may be used
to adjust setting time and/or hardening, reduce water
demand, increase workability, entrain air, improve cost-
effectiveness or other properties.

Safety Precautions

Refer to the applicable Safety Data Sheet (SDS), which
should be consulted prior to the use of this product. These
SDS's are available at www.holcim.us.

Avoid direct contact with the skin. If contact occurs, wash
skin with water as soon as possible. Exposure of sufficient
duration to portland blast-furnace slag cement can cause
serious and potentially irreversible tissue destruction in
the form of chemical burns. If cement gets into the eyes,
immediately flush eyes thoroughly with water and seek
medical attention. Proper PPE is always required.
