SECTION 4: FIRST AID MEASURES

4.1. Description of First-aid Measures

General: Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. If you feel unwell, seek medical advice (show the label where
possible).

Inhalation: Using proper respiratory protection, move the exposed person to fresh air at once. Encourage exposed person to cough,
spit out, and blow nose to remove dust. Immediately call a poison center, physician, or emergency medical service.

Skin Contact: Remove contaminated clothing. Immediately drench affected area with water for at least 15 minutes. If exposed or
concerned: Get medical advice/attention. Obtain medical attention if irritation/rash develops or persists.

Eye Contact: Immediately rinse with water for at least 30 minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue
rinsing. Get immediate medical advice/attention.

Ingestion: Rinse mouth. Do NOT induce vomiting. Obtain medical attention.

4.2. Most Important Symptoms and Effects Both Acute and Delayed

General: May cause respiratoryirritation. Skin sensitization. Causes skin irritation. Causes serious eye damage. Causes damage to
organs (lung/respiratory system) through prolonged or repeated exposure (Inhalation). May cause cancer by inhalation.
Inhalation: Irritation of the respiratory tract and the other mucous membranes. Some studies show that exposure to respirable
crystalline silica (without silicosis) or that the disease silicosis may be associated with the increased incidence of several
autoimmune disorders such as scleroderma (thickening of the skin), systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and
diseases affecting the kidneys. Silicosis increases the risk of tuberculosis. Some studies show an increased incidence of chronic
kidney disease and end-stage renal disease in workers exposed to respirable crystalline silica.

Skin Contact: May cause an allergic skin reaction. Redness, pain, swelling, itching, burning, dryness, and dermatitis. Repeated
exposure may cause skin dryness or cracking.

Eye Contact: Causes permanent damage to the cornea, iris, or conjunctiva. Concrete may cause immediate or delayedirritation or
inflammation. Eye contact with wet concrete can cause moderate eyeirritation, chemical burns and blindness. Eye exposures
require immediate first aid and medical attention to prevent significant damage to the eye.

Ingestion: Ingestion may cause adverse effects.

Chronic Symptoms: Long term exposure to respirable crystalline silica results in a significant risk of developing silicosis and other
non-malignant respiratory disease, lung cancer, kidney effects, and immune system effects.

4.3. Indication of Any Immediate Medical Attention and Special Treatment Needed

If exposed or concerned, get medical advice and attention. If medical advice is needed, have product container or label at hand.

SECTION 5: FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES

5.1.  Extinguishing Media

and diseases affecting the kidneys. Silicosis increases the risk of tuberculosis. Some studies show an increased incidence of chronic
kidney disease and end-stage renal disease in workers exposed to respirable crystalline silica.

Symptoms/Injuries After Skin Contact: May cause an allergic skin reaction. Redness, pain, swelling, itching, burning, dryness, and
dermatitis. Repeated exposure may cause skin dryness or cracking.

Symptoms/Injuries After Eye Contact: Causes permanent damage to the cornea, iris, or conjunctiva. Concrete may cause immediate
or delayedirritation or inflammation. Eye contact with wet concrete can cause moderate eyeirritation, chemical burns and blindness.
Eye exposures require immeldliate first aid and medical attention to prevent significant damage to the eye.

Symptoms/Injuries After Ingestion: Ingestion may cause adverse effects.

Chronic Symptoms: Long term exposure to respirable crystalline silica results in a significant risk of developing silicosis and other non-
malignant respiratory disease, lung cancer, kidney effects, and immune system effects.
