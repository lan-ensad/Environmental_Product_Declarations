3. Product Description

Usage

Mortamix® masonry cement is a formulated cementitious
material manufactured to be used in producing masonry
mortars for brick, block and stone masonry units. Mortamix®
masonry cement also can be used to produce stucco, a
versatile facing material that can be applied to wall or
ceiling surfaces to achieve special architectural finishes.

Composition and Materials

Mortamix® masonry cement is a combination of portland
cement, plasticizers, ground limestone and air entraining
additives. The above ingredients are combined and
processed at Holcim (US) Inc. manufacturing facilities under
controlled conditions to ensure uniform conformance.

Types

Mortamix® masonry cement is produced to meet ASTM
C91 standard specification requirements for Type N, Type
S or Type M masonry cements. When mixed with proper
proportion of sand (meeting ASTM C144) and clean water,
the resulting mortar conforms to the property specifications
of ASTM C270 for Type N, Type S or Type M mortar.

While climate conditions, exposure and engineering
requirements must be considered, Type N mortar is
recommended for above-grade interior and exterior load-
bearing and non-load bearing walls. Type S and M mortars
are recommended for below grade walls and load-bearing
walls where higher compressive strengths are needed.

Sizes
Mortamix® masonry cement is available in the following
packaging sizes (bags):

= Type N 32 kilogram (70.5 poundl)
= Type S 34 kilogram (75 poundl)
= Type M 32 kilogram (79.4 pound)

5. Installation

Preparatory Work

Mortamix® masonry cement should be mixed according
to ASTM C270. Machine mixing is highly recommended.
Mixing instructions are printed on each bag and shown
below:

# Use 1 bag Mortamix® masonry cement to 2-1/4 to 3
parts damp loose sand by volume. Sand requirements
are outlined in ASTM C144.

Batching Sequence:

# First add approximately 3/4 of the desired volume of
mix water; then add 1/2 the sand followed by 1 bag of
Mortamix® masonry cement to the mixer.

# Finally, add the rest of the sand and remaining mix
water sufficient to achieve the desired field workability.

s The combined materials should be mixed 3-5 minutes
after all materials are in the mixer.

Precautions

# Never change sand sources or mortar mixture
proportion volumes during the project; undesirable
color changes and performance changes to the finished
product could result.

# Holcim (US) Inc. does not recommend the use of any
other additives or admixtures.

# Tool all joints to the same degree of firmness in a
uniform consistent manner.

# Avoid excessive re-tempering, which could result in
color variations.

# Protect masonry units from weather before and after
they are set in place.

# Holcim (US) Inc. does not recommend the use of
acid-based cleaning solutions.

# To verify finished appearance, Holcim (US) Inc. always
recommends that a job specific sample panel be
erected; using the same sand, masonry units and
construction practice used on your project.

Safety Precautions

Refer to the applicable Safety Data Sheet (SDS), which
should be consulted prior to the use of this product. These
SDS's are available at www.holcim.us.

Avoid direct contact with the skin. If contact occurs,
wash skin with water as soon as possible. Exposure of
sufficient duration to masonry cement can cause serious
and potentially irreversible tissue destruction in the form
of chemical burns. If masonry cement gets into the eyes,
immediately flush eyes thoroughly with water and seek
medical attention. Proper PPE is always required.

Storage and Handling

Packaged masonry cements needing to be temporarily
stored on construction sites should be stored above
the ground on pallets or other means that allow airflow
between the ground and the stored packaged material.
Tarps or polyethylene sheeting should cover the material
when not in use to prevent moisture, precipitation or high
humidity from coming in contact with the bags. Prevent
storage directly against walls or other structures and allow
pallets to have an adequate space to allow for air circulation
to reduce moisture accumulations. Construction sites and
weather conditions vary and further measures may be
required to protect products from moisture.
