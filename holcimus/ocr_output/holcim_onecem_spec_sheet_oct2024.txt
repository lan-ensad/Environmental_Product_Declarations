3. Product Description

Usage

OneCem® is a portland limestone cement meeting the
requirements of ASTM C595 Standard Specification for
Blended Hydraulic Cement. OneCem® is a building material
that can be used in a wide variety of concrete construction,
including commercial and architectural applications.
Concrete made with OneCem® using proper mix design
and construction practices can be durable and resistant
to the impact of harsh environmental influences, such
as freezing and thawing, exposure to de-icing chemicals,
chloride ingress, and sulfate attack.

Uses include:

Bridges # Precast
# Cast-in-place # Pre-stress or post-tension
= Concrete Masonry Units = Ready-mix
(CMU) m Roads
# Drains # Soil Stabilization
” Grout m Tilt-up
# Masonry = Watertanks
= Pipe
Packaging

OneCem® portland limestone cementis regionally available
and can be supplied in bulk quantities or may be regionally
available in bags.

Composition and Materials

The primary ingredients of OneCem® are calcium silicate
based clinker, limestone and gypsum ground to a fine
powder that, when mixed with water, sets and hardens. The
hydration of calcium silicates forms a fiber-like material
called calcium silicate hydrate (CSH).

Al manufacturing is quality controlled to ensure product
conformance.

Benefits

Portland limestone cement is a versatile building material
that is suitable for a variety of construction applications. To
achieve these and other special properties, particular care
is needed when proportioning, batching, placing, finishing
and curing concrete containing these products.

Limitations

There are many variables that affect concrete performance
beyond the control of the cement manufacturer. Good
concreting practices are required in order to achieve desired
results. Attention must be given to formwork, batching,
mixing, placing, finishing and curing.In special applications,
selection of aggregates, admixtures and additives may
need to be scrutinized. Holcim (US) Inc. recommendés that
all concrete mix proportions be evaluated for acceptable
performance prior to use.

5. Installation

Requirements

For installation, consult specific project requirements or
applicable specifications and guides as available from
the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM),
American Concrete Institute (ACI),, or other reputable
industry organization.

Preparatory Work

Deliver products in manufacturer's original, unopened,
undamaged, containers with identification labels intact.
Store materials protected from exposure to harmful
environmental conditions and at temperatures and
humidity conditions recommended by the manufacturer.

Verify that site conditions are acceptable for installation. Do
not proceed with installation until unacceptable conditions
are corrected.

Methods

Concrete is a material that includes several constituents
such as cement, aggregate (usually sand and gravel), water,
and admixtures. Freshly mixed concrete should generally
be plastic or semi-fluid and moldable.

Good concreting practices are required for durable and
strong concrete. Proper proportioning, batching, mixing,
placing, consolidating, finishing and curing, as well as
proper subgrade preparation, formwork, uniform slump,
special techniques and other steps are all critical to
achieving the desired results.

The character of concrete is largely determined by the
water-cement ratio (w/c), and is especially critical to a
durable, strong concrete. Freshly mixed (plastic) and
hardened properties of concrete can be enhanced by
adding supplementary cementitious materials (SCM's)
or admixtures during batching. Admixtures may be used
to adjust setting time and/or hardening, reduce water
demand, increase workability, entrain air, improve cost-
effectiveness or other properties.

Safety Precautions

Refer to the applicable Safety Data Sheet (SDS), which
should be consulted prior to the use of this product. These
SDS's are available at www.holcim.us.

Avoid direct contact with the skin. If contact occurs, wash
skin with water as soon as possible. Exposure of sufficient
duration to cement can cause serious and potentially
irreversible tissue destruction in the form of chemical
burns. If cement gets into the eyes, immediately flush eyes
thoroughly with water and seek medical attention. Proper
PPE is always required.
