5. Installation

Preparatory Work

Mortamix® Rainbow Custom Color Mortar CementT" should
be mixed in accordance with the proportions outlined in
ASTM C270.Machine mixing is highly recommended. Mixing
instructions are printed on each bag and shown below:

# Use 1 bag Mortar cement to 2-1/4 to 3 parts damp
loose sand by volume. Sand requirements are outlined
in ASTM C144.

Batching Sequence:

# First add approximately 3/4 of the desired volume of
mix water; then add 1/2 the sand followed by 1 bag of
Mortar cement to the mixer.

# Finally, add the rest of the sand and remaining mix
water sufficient to achieve the desired field workability.

# The combined materials should be mixed 3-5 minutes
after all materials are in the mixer.

Precautions

# Never change sand sources or mortar mixture
proportion volumes during the project; undesirable
color changes and performance changes to the finished
product could result.

# Holcim (US) Inc. does not recommend the use of any
other additives or admixtures.

# Tool all joints to the same degree of firmness in a
uniform consistent manner.

# Avoid excessive re-tempering, which could result in
color variations.

# Protect masonry units from weather before and after
they are set in place.

# Holcim (US) Inc. does not recommend the use of acid-
based cleaning solutions.

# To verify finished appearance, Holcim (US) Inc. always
recommends that a job specific sample panel be
erected; using the same sand, masonry units and
construction practice used on your project.

Safety Precautions

Refer to the applicable Safety Data Sheet (SDS), which
should be consulted prior to the use of this product. These
SDS's are available at www.holcim.us.

Avoid direct contact with the skin. If contact occurs, wash
skin with water as soon as possible. Exposure of sufficient
duration to mortar cement can cause serious and potentially
irreversible tissue destruction in the form of chemical burns.
If mortar cement gets into the eyes, immediately flush eyes
thoroughly with water and seek medical attention. Proper
PPE is always required.

Storage and Handling

Packaged mortar cements needing to be temporarily stored
on construction sites should be stored above the ground
on pallets or other means that allow airflow between
the ground and the stored packaged material. Tarps or
polyethylene sheeting should cover the material when not
in use to prevent moisture, precipitation or high humidity
from coming in contact with the bags. Prevent storage
directly against walls or other structures and allow pallets
to have an adequate space to allow for air circulation to
reduce moisture accumulations. Construction sites and
weather conditions vary and further measures may be
required to protect products from moisture.
