Slag cement, UN CPC 3744, is defined in ASTM C128 as granulated blast-furnace slag that has been ground to
cement fineness, with or without additions, and that is a hydraulic cement [2]. Slag cement is a supplementary
cementitious material (SCM). Iron blast furnace slag (BFS) is a waste material of pig iron production and as such is
categorized as a “recovered material” [2]. To transform iron BFS, so it can be used as a SCM in concrete and
mortars, it is first rapidly quenched with water to form granules known as Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GBFS). It
then undergoes dewatering, crushing of oversized material only (if applicable), and storage at the granulating
facilities. GBFS is then shipped to the grinding facilities where it undergoes dewatering/drying (if applicable), iron
removal from slag granules (if applicable), crushing (if applicable), grinding, and packaging (if applicable). The slag
cement is then stored onsite.

System Boundary

This EPD is a cradle-to-gate EPD covering the production stage (A1-A3) as depicted in the figure below. The
production stage includes extraction and recovery of raw materials (cradle) through the manufacture of slag cement
ready for shipment (gate). Downstream activity stages - Construction, Use, End-of-life, and Optional supplementary
information beyond the system boundary - are excluded from the system boundary. The South Chicago slag grinding
plant sources its granulated slag input from a facility it operates in East Chicago adjacent to a steel mill. This EPD
also includes, and is based on, life cycle inventory data collected from the East Chicago granulation facility.

properties that pose a concern for human health and/or the environment were identified in the framework of this EPD.
Any plant specific data gaps for the reference year 2019 (e.g., amount of lubricants) were filled in with industry data

(secondary data).

Allocation Rules

Allocation follows the requirements and guidance of ISO 14044 Clause 4.3.4 [5], NSF PCR [2], and ISO 21930
section 7.2 [3]. The sub-category PCR recognizes iron blast furnace slag as a recovered material and thus the
environmental impacts allocated to raw slag are limited to the treatment and transportation required to use as a
material input. “Mass” was used as the physical parameter for allocating flows between slag cement and other co-
products to calculate the input energy flows (e.g., electricity, natural gas, diesel), packaging materials, freshwater
consumption, process emissions to air, water and land and waste flows (if applicable). LCI modeling did consider the
plant specific manufacturing yield.

Description

Data represents the prevailing technology in use at both the East Chicago granulation facility and the South
Chicago grinding facility. Whenever available, for all upstream and core material and processes, North
American typical or average industry LCI datasets were utilized.

Technological representativeness is characterized as “high”.

The geographic region considered is U.S.
Geographical representativeness is characterized as "high".

Activity (primary) data are representative of 2019 calendar year (12 months).

- East Chicago slag granulation,

- South Chicago slag cement manufacturing,

- In-bound/ out-bound transportation data - primary data collected for granulation and slag cement
manufacturing plant.

- Generic data: the most appropriate LCI datasets were used as found in the ecoinvent v.3.5 database for
US and global, 2018 and US LCI Database. US LCI database (empty/missing LCI datasets) are substituted
With ecoinvent v3.5 LCI datasets.

Temporal representativeness is characterized as “high”.

All relevant, specific processes, including inputs (raw materials, energy and ancillary materials) and outputs
(emissions and production volume) were considered and modeled to complete production profile for South
Chicago slag cement.

The relevant background materials and processes were taken from the US LCI Database (adjusted for known
data placeholders), ecoinvent v 3.5 LCI database for US, and modeled in SimaPro software v.9.2.0.2, 2022.
The completeness of the cradle-to-gate process chain in terms of process steps is rigorously assessed for
all cement product systems

All relevant, specific processes, including inputs (raw materials, energy, and ancillary materials) and outputs
(emissions and production volume) were considered and modeled to complete production profile for South
Chicago slag cement.

The relevant background materials and processes were taken from the US LCI Database, ecoinvent v 3.5
LCI database for US, and modeled in SimaPro software v.9.2.0.2, 2022. The completeness of the cradle-to-
gate process chain in terms of process steps is rigorously assessed across product system.

Internal reproducibility is possible since the data and the models are stored and available in Holcim_ Athena
LCI database developed in SimaPro, 2022. A high level of transparency is provided throughout the report as
the LCI profile is presented for each of the declared products as well as major upstream inputs. Key primary
(manufacturer specific) and secondary (generic) LCI data sources are also summarized in the background
report. External reproducibility is not possible as the background report is confidential.

Activity and LCI datasets are disclosed in the project report, including all data sources.

A sensitivity check was conducted to assess the reliability of the EPD results and conclusions by determining
how they are affected by uncertainties in the data or assumptions on calculation of LCIA and energy indicator

results.

Life Cycle Impact Assessment Results: South Chicago Slag Cement

This section summarizes the product stage life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) results including resource use and
waste generated metrics based on the cradle-to-gate life cycle inventory inputs and outputs analysis. The results are
calculated based on 1 metric ton of slag cement as produced at the South Chicago, IL plant. /f should be noted that
LCIA results are relative expressions and do not predict impacts on category endpoints, the exceeding of thresholds,
safety margins or risks [4], [5]. Further, a number of LCA impact categories and inventory items are still emerging or
under development and can have high levels of uncertainty that preclude international acceptance pending further
development. Use caution when interpreting results for these categories — identified with an “*” [2].

LCA Interpretation

The Manufacturing module (A3) drives most of the potential environmental impacts. Manufacturing impacts are
primarily driven by energy use (electricity and thermal fuels) used during the drying and grinding of slag granules.
Raw material extraction (A1) is a minor contributor to the overall EPD results. Transportation (A2) contributes
significantly to overall smog formation and acidification impacts (>10%) but otherwise is a minor contributor to the
overall environmental footprint.

Additional Environmental Information
