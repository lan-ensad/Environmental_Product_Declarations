Fly ash and bottom ash are byproducts from the combustion of coal. Trace amounts of chemicals may be detected during chemical
analysis. For example, the chemicals identified can include carbon and complex silicates or oxides of aluminum (Al), calcium (Ca),
magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), sulfur (S), potassium (K), titanium (Ti), iron (Fe) and phosphorus (P). Chemical identity: MxOySiO2 (M =
Al, Ca, Mg and other minor metal, with bound silica (SiO2)). Chemical analysis of fly ash and bottom ash also indicate the presence of
trace amounts of metals, such as: Arsenic (As), Barium (Ba), Beryllium (Be), Cobalt (Co), Lead (Pb), and Manganese (Mn).

4.1. Description of First-aid Measures

General: Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. If you feel unwell, seek medical advice (show the label where
possible).

Inhalation: When symptoms occur: go into open air and ventilate suspected area. Obtain medical attention if breathing difficulty
persists.

Skin Contact: Remove contaminated clothing. Drench affected area with water for at least 15 minutes. If exposed or concerned: Get
medical advice/attention.

Eye Contact: Rinse cautiously with water for at least 5 minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue rinsing.
Obtain medical attention if irritation develops or persists.

Ingestion: Rinse mouth. Do NOT induce vomiting. Obtain medical attention.

4.2. Most Important Symptoms and Effects Both Acute and Delayed

General: Causes damage to organs (lung/respiratory system) through prolonged or repeated exposure (Inhalation). May cause
cancer by inhalation.

Inhalation: Prolonged exposure may causeirritation. Some studies show that exposure to respirable crystalline silica (without
silicosis) or that the disease silicosis may be associated with the increased incidence of several autoimmune disorders such as
scleroderma (thickening of the skin), systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and diseases affecting the kidneys. Silicosis
increases the risk of tuberculosis. Some studies show an increased incidence of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease
in workers exposed to respirable crystalline silica.

Skin Contact: Prolonged exposure may cause skin irritation.
