GHS-US/CA Labeling

No labeling applicable according to 29 CFR 1910.1200 and the Hazardous Products Regulations (HPR) SOR/2015-17.

2.3. Other Hazards

This product contains crystalline silica, which naturally varies depending on the composition of the soil. Clay, decomposed matter,
and moisture likely prevent crystalline silica from becoming respirable. If crystalline silica dust is released into the air, repeated
exposure to dust may cause lung damage in the form of silicosis, lung cancer, or respiratory irritation. Symptoms will include
progressively more difficult breathing, cough, fever, and weight loss. Exposure may aggravate pre-existing eye, skin, or respiratory
conditions.

*Percentages are listed in weight by weight percentage (w/w%) for liquid and solid ingredients. Gas ingredients are listed in volume
by volume percentage (v/v%).

4.1. Description of First-aid Measures

General: Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. If you feel unwell, seek medical advice (show the label where
possible).

Inhalation: When symptoms occur: go into open air and ventilate suspected area. Obtain medical attention if breathing difficulty
persists.

Skin Contact: Remove contaminated clothing. Gently wash with plenty of soap and water. Obtain medical attention ifirritation
develops or persists.

Eye Contact: Rinse cautiously with water for at least 5 minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue rinsing.
Obtain medical attention if irritation develops or persists.

Ingestion: Rinse mouth. Do NOT induce vomiting. If you feel unwell, seek medical advice.

4.2. Most Important Symptoms and Effects Both Acute and Delayed

General: Not expected to present a significant hazard under anticipated conditions of normal use.

Inhalation: Prolonged exposure may causeirritation. Some studies show that exposure to respirable crystalline silica (without
silicosis) or that the disease silicosis may be associated with the increased incidence of several autoimmune disorders such as
scleroderma (thickening of the skin), systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and diseases affecting the kidneys. Silicosis
increases the risk of tuberculosis. Some studies show an increased incidence of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease
in workers exposed to respirable crystalline silica.

Skin Contact: Direct contact may cause irritation by mechanical abrasion.

Eye Contact: Contact may causeirritation due to mechanical abrasion.

Ingestion: Ingestion of large quantities may cause adverse effects.

Chronic Symptoms: None expected under normal conditions of use.

4.3. Indication of Any Immediate Medical Attention and Special Treatment Needed

If exposed or concerned, get medical advice and attention.

SECTION 5: FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES

5.1.  Extinguishing Media

Suitable Extinguishing Media: Use extinguishing media suitable for surrounding type of fire.
Unsuitable Extinguishing Media: None.

5.2. Special Hazards Arising From the Substance or Mixture

Fire Hazard: Not flammable.

Explosion Hazard: Product is not explosive.

Reactivity: Hazardous reactions will not occur under normal conditions.

5.3. Advice for Firefighters

Precautionary Measures Fire: Exercise caution when fighting any chemical fire.

Firefighting Instructions: Use water spray or fog for cooling exposed containers.

Protection During Firefighting: Do not enter fire area without proper protective equipment, including respiratory protection.
