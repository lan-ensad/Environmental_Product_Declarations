2.3. Other Hazards

Exposure may aggravate individuals with pre-existing skin, kidney, liver, and pulmonary disorders. Asphalt may contain trace
quantities of benzene (<0.1%). Elevated temperature conditions may emit hydrogen sulfide, an asphalt decomposition product. If
stored under heat for extended periods or significantly agitated, this material might evolve or release hydrogen sulfide, a flammable
gas, which can raise and widen this material's actual flammability limits and significantly lower its auto-ignition temperature.
Hydrogen sulfide is a toxic gas that can be fatal. It also has a rotten egg smell that causes odor fatigue very quickly and shouldn't be
used as an indicator for the presence of gas. Risk of thermal burns on contact with molten product. Hot asphalt can release toxic
Hydrogen Sulfide gas! Hydrogen Sulfide can accumulate in vapor space of tanks and vessels during transfer and storage of this
material. Exposure may aggravate pre-existing eye, skin, or respiratory conditions.

SECTION 4: FIRST AID MEASURES

4.1. Description of First-aid Measures

General: Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. If you feel unwell, seek medical advice (show the label where
possible).

Inhalation: When symptoms occur: go into open air and ventilate suspected area. Obtain medical attention if breathing difficulty
persists.

Skin Contact: Remove contaminated clothing. Drench affected area with water for at least 15 minutes. If exposed or concerned: Get
medical advice/attention.

Eye Contact: Rinse cautiously with water for at least 5 minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue rinsing.
Obtain medical attention if irritation develops or persists.

Ingestion: Rinse mouth. Do NOT induce vomiting. Obtain medical attention.

4.2. Most Important Symptoms and Effects Both Acute and Delayed

General: May cause cancer. Causes damage to organs (lung/respiratory system) through prolonged or repeated exposure
(Inhalation). Health effects from silica exposures include: silicosis, a disabling, non-reversible and sometimes fatal lung disease;
other non-malignant respiratory diseases, such as chronic bronchitis; lung cancer; and kidney disease, including nephritis and end-
stage renal disease. This product, if heated may release asphalt fumes. During processing, inhalation of fumes may cause dizziness
and/or irritation to the eyes, nose, and throat. Hot molten product will cause thermal burns to the skin.

Inhalation: Some studies show that exposure to respirable crystalline silica (without silicosis) or that the disease silicosis may be
associated with the increased incidence of several autoimmune disorders such as scleroderma (thickening of the skin), systemic
lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and diseases affecting the kidneys. Silicosis increases the risk of tuberculosis. Some
studies show an increased incidence of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease in workers exposed to respirable
crystalline silica. WARNING: irritating and toxic hydrogen sulfide gas may be present. Greater than 15-20ppm continuous exposure
can cause mucous membrane and respiratory tract irritation. 50-500 ppm can cause headache, nausea, and dizziness. Continued
exposure at these levels can lead to loss of reasoning and balance, difficulty in breathing, fluid in the lungs, and possible loss of
consciousness. Greater than 500ppm can cause rapid unconsciousness and death if not promptly revived. Prolonged exposure may
cause irritation.

Skin Contact: Prolonged exposure may cause skinirritation. Risk of thermal burns on contact with molten product.

Eye Contact: May cause slight irritation to eyes. Risk of thermal burns on contact with molten product.

Ingestion: Ingestion may cause adverse effects.

Chronic Symptoms: May cause cancer. Causes damage to organs (lungs, respiratory system) through prolonged or repeated
exposure (Inhalation). Long term exposure to respirable crystalline silica results in a significant risk of developing silicosis and other
non-malignant respiratory disease, lung cancer, kidney effects, and immune system effects.

4.3. Indication of Any Immediate Medical Attention and Special Treatment Needed
If exposed or concerned, get medical advice and attention. If medical advice is needed, have product container or label at hand.

SECTION 5: FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES

5.1.  Extinguishing Media

Suitable Extinguishing Media: Water spray, dry chemical, foam, carbon dioxide.

Unsuitable Extinguishing Media: Do not use a heavy water stream. Use of heavy stream of water may spread fire.

5.2. Special Hazards Arising From the Substance or Mixture

Fire Hazard: Not considered flammable but may burn at high temperatures.

Explosion Hazard: Product is not explosive.

Reactivity: Hazardous reactions will not occur under normal conditions.

5.3. Advice for Firefighters

Precautionary Measures Fire: Exercise caution when fighting any chemical fire.

Firefighting Instructions: Use water spray or fog for cooling exposed containers.

Protection During Firefighting: Do not enter fire area without proper protective equipment, including respiratory protection.
Hazardous Combustion Products: Carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, smoke, fumes, unburned hydrocarbons and oxides of sulfur
and/or nitrogen. Hydrogen sulfide and other sulfur-containing gases can evolve from this product particularly at elevated
temperatures.

SECTION 6: ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

6.1. Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures

General Measures: Do not breathe dust. Do not get in eyes, on skin, or on clothing. Do not handle until all safety precautions have
been read and understood.

6.1.1. For Non-Emergency Personnel

Emergency Procedures: Evacuate unnecessary personnel.

6.1.2. For Emergency Personnel

Protective Equipment: Equip cleanup crew with proper protection.

Emergency Procedures: Upon arrival at the scene, a first responder is expected to recognize the presence of dangerous goods,
protect oneself and the public, secure the area, and call for the assistance of trained personnel as soon as conditions permit.
Ventilate area.

6.2. Environmental Precautions

Avoid release to the environment. Prevent entry to sewers and public waters.

6.3. Methods and Materials for Containment and Cleaning Up

For Containment: Contain solid spills with appropriate barriers and prevent migration and entry into sewers or streams.

Methods for Cleaning Up: Clean up spills immediately and dispose of waste safely. Recover the product by vacuuming, shoveling or
sweeping. Transfer spilled material to a suitable container for disposal. Contact competent authorities after a spill.

6.4. Reference to Other Sections

See Section 8 for exposure controls and personal protection and Section 13 for disposal considerations.

SECTION 7: HANDLING AND STORAGE

7.1. Precautions for Safe Handling

Additional Hazards When Processed: If stored under heat for extended periods or significantly agitated, this material might evolve
or release hydrogen sulfide, a flammable gas, which can raise and widen this material's actual flammability limits and significantly
lower its auto-ignition temperature. Hydrogen sulfide is a toxic gas that can be fatal. It also has a rotten egg smell that causes odor
fatigue very quickly and shouldn't be used as an indicator for the presence of gas. Repeated or prolonged exposure to respirable
(airborne) crystalline silica dust will cause lung damage in the form of silicosis. Symptoms will include progressively more difficult
breathing, cough, fever, and weight loss. This product, if heated may release asphalt fumes. During processing, inhalation of fumes
may cause dizziness and/or irritation to the eyes, nose, and throat. Hot molten product will cause thermal burns to the skin. Heavy
material- proper lifting methods or equipment.

Precautions for Safe Handling: Obtain special instructions before use. Do not handle until all safety precautions have been read and
understood. Wash hands and other exposed areas with mild soap and water before eating, drinking or smoking and when leaving
work. Do not breathe dust. Avoid contact with eyes, skin and clothing.

Hygiene Measures: Handle in accordance with good industrial hygiene and safety procedures.

7.2. Conditions for Safe Storage, Including Any Incompatibilities

Technical Measures: Comply with applicable regulations.

Storage Conditions: Keep container closed when not in use. Store in a dry, cool place. Store away from incompatible materials.
Keep/Store away from direct sunlight, extremely high or low temperatures and incompatible materials. Store locked up/in a secure
area.

Incompatible Materials: Alum. Ammonium salts. Chlorates. Fluorine. Formaldehyde. Nitrates. Peroxides. Strong acids. When
molten: water.

Storage Temperature: Unlimited
