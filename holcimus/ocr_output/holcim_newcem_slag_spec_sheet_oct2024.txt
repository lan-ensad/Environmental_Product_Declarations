3. Product Description

Usage

NewCem® slag cement is a pre-
consumer recycled material. It is typically
used in concrete mixtures as a partial
replacement for portland or portland
limestone cement. Slag cement is
manufactured using less production
energy than portland cement. Use of
this material may contribute to achieving
points or credits in LEEDS or other green
building assessment systems.

Slag cement is a building material which is used in a
wide variety of concrete construction applications. When
properly proportioned in concrete mixtures, slag cement is
particularly suitable for providing light color, sulfate and
alkali-silica reaction (ASR) resistance, low permeability and
low heat for mass-concrete applications.

Uses include:

Bridges # Precast
# Cast-in-place # Pre-stress or post-tension
# Concrete Masonry Units = Ready-mix
(CMU) s Roads
# Drains # Soil Stabilization
s Grout ms Tilt-Up
# Masonry = Watertanks
= Pipe
Packaging

NewCem® slag cement is regionally available in bulk
quantities.

Composition and Materials

The primary ingredient of slag cement is granulated blast-
furnace slag (GBFS) that is ground to a fine powder. Slag
cement is a by-product of iron manufacturing. When mixed
with water and portland cement or portland limestone
cement, the concrete sets and hardens. The hydration
reaction forms a fiber-like material called calcium silicate
hydrate (CSH).

conformance.

Benefits

Slag cement is a versatile building material that is suitable
for a variety of concrete construction applications. To
achieve these and other special properties, particular care
is needed when proportioning, batching, placing, finishing
and curing concrete containing these products.

Limitations

There are many variables that affect concrete performance
beyond the control of the cement manufacturer. Good
concreting practices are required in order to achieve desired
results. Attention must be given to formwork, batching,
mixing, placing, finishing and curing.In special applications,
selection of aggregates, admixtures and additives may
need to be scrutinized. Holcim (US) Inc. recommendés that
all concrete mix proportions be evaluated for acceptable
performance prior to use.

PRODUCT SPECIFICATION SHEET

Physical / Chemical Properties

Slag cements are manufactured to conform to all applicable
requirements for the designated type of ASTM C989 and
AASHTO M 302.

5. Installation

Requirements

For installation, consult specific project requirements or
applicable specifications and guides as available from
the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM),
American Concrete Institute (ACI),, or other reputable
industry organization.

Preparatory Work

Deliver products in manufacturer's original, unopened,
undamaged, containers with identification labels intact.
Store materials protected from exposure to harmful
environmental conditions and at temperatures and
humidity conditions recommended by the manufacturer.

Verify that site conditions are acceptable for installation. Do
not proceed with installation until unacceptable conditions
are corrected.

Methods

Concrete is a material that includes several constituents
such as cement, aggregate (usually sand and gravel), water,
and admixtures. Freshly mixed concrete should generally
be plastic or semi-fluid and moldable.

Good concreting practices are required for durable and
strong concrete. Proper proportioning, batching, mixing,
placing, consolidating, finishing and curing, as well as
proper subgrade preparation, formwork, uniform slump,
special techniques and other steps are all critical to
achieving the desired results.

The character of concrete is largely determined by the
water-cement ratio (w/c), and is especially critical to a
durable, strong concrete. Freshly mixed (plastic) and
hardened properties of concrete can be enhanced by
adding supplementary cementitious materials (SCM's)
or admixtures during batching. Admixtures may be used
to adjust setting time and/or hardening, reduce water
demand, increase workability, entrain air, improve cost-
effectiveness or other properties.

Safety Precautions

Refer to the applicable Safety Data Sheet (SDS), which
should be consulted prior to the use of this product. These
SDS's are available at www.holcim.us.

Avoid direct contact with the skin. If contact occurs, wash
skin with water as soon as possible. Exposure of sufficient
duration to cement can cause serious and potentially
irreversible tissue destruction in the form of chemical
burns. If cement gets into the eyes, immediately flush eyes
thoroughly with water and seek medical attention. Proper
PPE is always required.
