SECTION 4: FIRST AID MEASURES

4.1. Description of First-aid Measures

General: Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. If you feel unwell, seek medical advice (show the label where
possible).

Inhalation: When symptoms occur: go into open air and ventilate suspected area. Obtain medical attention if breathing difficulty
persists.

Skin Contact: Remove contaminated clothing. Immediately drench affected area with water for at least 15 minutes. If exposed or
concerned: Get medical advice/attention. Obtain medical attention if irritation/rash develops or persists.

Eye Contact: Immediately rinse with water for at least 30 minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue
rinsing. Get immediate medical advice/attention.

Ingestion: Rinse mouth. Do NOT induce vomiting. Obtain medical attention.

4.2. Most Important Symptoms and Effects Both Acute and Delayed

General: May cause respiratoryirritation. Causes damage to organs (lung/respiratory system) through prolonged or repeated
exposure (Inhalation). May cause cancer by inhalation. Skin sensitization. Causes skin irritation. Causes serious eye damage.
Inhalation: Irritation of the respiratory tract and the other mucous membranes. Some studies show that exposure to respirable
crystalline silica (without silicosis) or that the disease silicosis may be associated with the increased incidence of several
autoimmune disorders such as scleroderma (thickening of the skin), systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and
diseases affecting the kidneys. Silicosis increases the risk of tuberculosis. Some studies show an increased incidence of chronic
kidney disease and end-stage renal disease in workers exposed to respirable crystalline silica.

Skin Contact: Redness, pain, swelling, itching, burning, dryness, and dermatitis. May cause an allergic skin reaction. May cause skin
to become dry or cracked.

Eye Contact: Causes permanent damage to the cornea, iris, or conjunctiva. Concrete may cause immediate or delayedirritation or
inflammation. Eye contact with wet concrete can cause moderate eyeirritation, chemical burns and blindness. Eye exposures
require immediate first aid and medical attention to prevent significant damage to the eye.

Ingestion: Ingestion may cause adverse effects.

Chronic Symptoms: Long term exposure to respirable crystalline silica results in a significant risk of developing silicosis and other
non-malignant respiratory disease, lung cancer, kidney effects, and immune system effects.

Safety Data Sheet
According To Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 58 / Monday, March 26, 2012 / Rules And Regulations And According To The Hazardous Products Regulation (February 11, 2015).

Reproductive Toxicity: Not classified

Specific Target Organ Toxicity (Single Exposure): May cause respiratory irritation.

Aspiration Hazard: Not classified

Symptoms/Injuries After Inhalation: Irritation of the respiratory tract and the other mucous membranes. Some studies show that
exposure to respirable crystalline silica (without silicosis) or that the disease silicosis may be associated with the increased incidence
of several autoimmune disorders such as scleroderma (thickening of the skin), systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis
and diseases affecting the kidneys. Silicosis increases the risk of tuberculosis. Some studies show an increased incidence of chronic
kidney disease and end-stage renal disease in workers exposed to respirable crystalline silica.

Symptoms/Injuries After Skin Contact: Redness, pain, swelling, itching, burning, dryness, and dermatitis. May cause an allergic skin
reaction. May cause skin to become dry or cracked.

Symptoms/Injuries After Eye Contact: Causes permanent damage to the cornea, iris, or conjunctiva. Concrete may cause immediate
or delayedirritation or inflammation. Eye contact with wet concrete can cause moderate eyeirritation, chemical burns and blindness.
Eye exposures require immeldliate first aid and medical attention to prevent significant damage to the eye.

Symptoms/Injuries After Ingestion: Ingestion may cause adverse effects.

Chronic Symptoms: Long term exposure to respirable crystalline silica results in a significant risk of developing silicosis and other non-
malignant respiratory disease, lung cancer, kidney effects, and immune system effects.
