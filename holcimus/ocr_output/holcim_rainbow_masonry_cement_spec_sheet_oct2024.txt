3. Product Description

Usage

Mortamix® Rainbow Custom Color Masonry CementM"M is
a formulated cementitious material manufactured to be
used in producing masonry mortars for brick, block and
stone masonry units. Mortamix® Rainbow Custom Color
Masonry CementT" also can be used to produce stucco,
a versatile facing material that can be applied to wall or
ceiling surfaces to achieve special architectural finishes.
Mortamix® Rainbow Custom Color Masonry CementT" can

architectural accent or specified masonry unit.

Composition and Materials

Mortamix® Rainbow Custom Color Masonry CementM"M is
a combination of portland cement, plasticizers, ground
limestone, air entraining additives and inorganic oxide
color pigments. The above ingredients are combined and
processed at Holcim (US) Inc. manufacturing facilities under
controlled conditions to ensure uniform conformance.

Types

Mortamix® Rainbow Custom Color Masonry Cement'"
is produced to meet ASTM C91, standard specification
requirements for Type N, TypeS or Type M masonry cements.
When mixed with proper proportion of sand (meeting ASTM
C144) and clean water, the resulting mortar conforms to the
property specifications of ASTM C270 for Type N, Type S or
Type M mortar.

While climate conditions, exposure and engineering
requirements must be considered, Type N mortar is
recommended for above-grade interior and exterior load-
bearing and non-load bearing walls. Type S and M mortars
are a higher compressive strength and are recommended
for below grade walls and load-bearing walls where higher
compressive strengths are needed.

proportion volumes during the project; undesirable
color changes and performance changes to the finished
product could result.

# Holcim (US) Inc. does not recommend the use of any
other additives or admixtures.

# Tool all joints to the same degree of firmness in a
uniform consistent manner.

# Avoid excessive re-tempering, which could result in
color variations.

# Protect masonry units from weather before and after
they are set in place.

# Holcim (US) Inc. does not recommend the use of acid-
based cleaning solutions.

# To verify finished appearance, Holcim (US) Inc. always
recommends that a job specific sample panel be
erected; using the same sand, masonry units and
construction practice used on your project.

Safety Precautions

Refer to the applicable Safety Data Sheet (SDS), which
should be consulted prior to the use of this product. These
SDS's are available at www.holcim.us.

Avoid direct contact with the skin. If contact occurs, wash
skin with water as soon as possible. Exposure of sufficient
duration to Mortamix® Rainbow Custom Color Masonry
Cement'" can cause serious and potentially irreversible
tissue destruction in the form of chemical burns. If
masonry cement gets into the eyes, immediately flush eyes
thoroughly with water and seek medical attention. Proper
PPE is always required.

Storage and Handling

Packaged masonry cements needing to be temporarily
stored on construction sites should be stored above
the ground on pallets or other means that allow airflow
between the ground and the stored packaged material.
Tarps or polyethylene sheeting should cover the material
when not in use to prevent moisture, precipitation or high
humidity from coming in contact with the bags. Prevent
storage directly against walls or other structures and allow
pallets to have an adequate space to allow for air circulation
to reduce moisture accumulations. Construction sites
and weather conditions vary and further measures may
be required to protect products from moisture.
