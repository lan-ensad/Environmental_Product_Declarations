4.1. Description of First-aid Measures

General: Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. If you feel unwell, seek medical advice (show the label where
possible).

Inhalation: When symptoms occur: go into open air and ventilate suspected area. Obtain medical attention if breathing difficulty
persists.

Skin Contact: Remove contaminated clothing. Drench affected area with water for at least 15 minutes. If exposed or concerned: Get
medical advice/attention.

Eye Contact: Rinse cautiously with water for at least 5 minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue rinsing.
Obtain medical attention if irritation develops or persists.

Ingestion: Rinse mouth. Do NOT induce vomiting. Obtain medical attention.

4.2. Most Important Symptoms and Effects Both Acute and Delayed

General: Dust particles may irritate the skin, eyes and respiratory tract. Dust particles may cause itching, rash, redness and swelling
to the skin and eyes. Causes damage to organs (lung/respiratory system) through prolonged or repeated exposure (Inhalation). May
cause cancer by inhalation.

Inhalation: Some studies show that exposure to respirable crystalline silica (without silicosis) or that the disease silicosis may be
associated with the increased incidence of several autoimmune disorders such as scleroderma (thickening of the skin), systemic
lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and diseases affecting the kidneys. Silicosis increases the risk of tuberculosis. Some
studies show an increased incidence of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease in workers exposed to respirable
crystalline silica.
