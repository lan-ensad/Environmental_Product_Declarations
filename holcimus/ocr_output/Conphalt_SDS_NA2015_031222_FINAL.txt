*Percentages are listed in weight by weight percentage (w/w%) for liquid and solid ingredients. Gas ingredients are listed in volume
by volume percentage (v/v%).

4.1. Description of First-aid Measures

General: Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. If you feel unwell, seek medical advice (show the label where
possible).

Inhalation: When symptoms occur: go into open air and ventilate suspected area. Obtain medical attention if breathing difficulty
persists.

Skin Contact: Remove contaminated clothing. Immediately drench affected area with water for at least 15 minutes. If exposed or
concerned: Get medical advice/attention. Obtain medical attention if irritation/rash develops or persists.

Eye Contact: Immediately rinse with water for at least 30 minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue
rinsing. Get immediate medical advice/attention.

Ingestion: Rinse mouth. Do NOT induce vomiting. Obtain medical attention.

4.2. Most Important Symptoms and Effects Both Acute and Delayed

General: Causes serious eye damage. Causes skin irritation. May cause respiratory irritation. May cause cancer by inhalation. .
Causes damage to organs (lung/respiratory system) through prolonged or repeated exposure (Inhalation). Risk of thermal burns on
contact with molten product.

Inhalation: Irritation of the respiratory tract and the other mucous membranes. Some studies show that exposure to respirable
crystalline silica (without silicosis) or that the disease silicosis may be associated with the increased incidence of several
autoimmune disorders such as scleroderma (thickening of the skin), systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and
diseases affecting the kidneys. Silicosis increases the risk of tuberculosis. Some studies show an increased incidence of chronic
kidney disease and end-stage renal disease in workers exposed to respirable crystalline silica.

Skin Contact: Redness, pain, swelling, itching, burning, dryness, and dermatitis. May cause an allergic skin reaction. May cause skin
to become dry or cracked.

Eye Contact: Causes permanent damage to the cornea, iris, or conjunctiva. Airborne dust may cause immediate or delayed irritation
or inflammation. Eye contact with large amounts of dry powder or with wet cement can cause moderate eyeirritation, chemical
burns and blindness. Eye exposures require immediate first aid and medical attention to prevent significant damage to the eye.
Ingestion: Ingestion may cause adverse effects.

Chronic Symptoms: Long term exposure to respirable crystalline silica results in a significant risk of developing silicosis and other
non-malignant respiratory disease, lung cancer, kidney effects, and immune system effects.

4.3. Indication of Any Immediate Medical Attention and Special Treatment Needed

If exposed or concerned, get medical advice and attention. If medical advice is needed, have product container or label at hand.

SECTION 5: FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES

5.1.  Extinguishing Media

Suitable Extinguishing Media: Water spray, dry chemical, foam, carbon dioxide.

Unsuitable Extinguishing Media: Do not use a heavy water stream. Use of heavy stream of water may spread fire.

5.2. Special Hazards Arising From the Substance or Mixture

Fire Hazard: Not considered flammable but may burn at high temperatures.

Explosion Hazard: Product is not explosive.

Reactivity: Hazardous reactions will not occur under normal conditions.

5.3. Advice for Firefighters

Precautionary Measures Fire: Exercise caution when fighting any chemical fire.

Firefighting Instructions: Use water spray or fog for cooling exposed containers.

Protection During Firefighting: Do not enter fire area without proper protective equipment, including respiratory protection.
Hazardous Combustion Products: Carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, smoke, fumes, unburned hydrocarbons and oxides of sulfur
and/or nitrogen.

5.4. Reference to Other Sections

Refer to Section 9 for flammability properties.

SECTION 6: ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

6.1. Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures

Safety Data Sheet
According To Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 58 / Monday, March 26, 2012 / Rules And Regulations And According To The Hazardous Products Regulation (February 11, 2015).

6.1.1. For Non-Emergency Personnel

Protective Equipment: Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).

Emergency Procedures: Evacuate unnecessary personnel.

6.1.2. For Emergency Personnel

Protective Equipment: Equip cleanup crew with proper protection.

Emergency Procedures: Upon arrival at the scene, a first responder is expected to recognize the presence of dangerous goods,
protect oneself and the public, secure the area, and call for the assistance of trained personnel as soon as conditions permit.
Ventilate area.

6.2. Environmental Precautions

Prevent entry to sewers and public waters.

6.3. Methods and Materials for Containment and Cleaning Up

For Containment: Contain solid spills with appropriate barriers and prevent migration and entry into sewers or streams.
Methods for Cleaning Up: Clean up spills immediately and dispose of waste safely. Recover the product by vacuuming, shoveling or
sweeping. Vacuum clean-up is preferred. If sweeping is required use a dust suppressant. Transfer spilled material to a suitable
container for disposal. Contact competent authorities after a spill.

6.4. Reference to Other Sections

See Section 8 for exposure controls and personal protection and Section 13 for disposal considerations.

SECTION 7: HANDLING AND STORAGE

7.1. Precautions for Safe Handling

Additional Hazards When Processed: Cutting, crushing, sanding or grinding of crystalline silica-bearing materials will release
respirable crystalline silica. Use all appropriate measures of dust control or suppression, and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
described in Section 8 below. Heavy material - proper lifting methods or equipment.

Precautions for Safe Handling: Obtain special instructions before use. Do not handle until all safety precautions have been read and
understood. Do not get in eyes, on skin, or on clothing. Do not breathe dust. Wash hands and other exposed areas with mild soap
and water before eating, drinking or smoking and when leaving work.

Hygiene Measures: Handle in accordance with good industrial hygiene and safety procedures.

7.2. Conditions for Safe Storage, Including Any Incompatibilities

Technical Measures: Comply with applicable regulations.

Storage Conditions: Keep container closed when not in use. Store in cool, dry area away from moisture, excessive heat, and sources
of ignition.

Incompatible Materials: Acids, ammonium salts and aluminum metal. Cement dissolves in hydrofluoric acid, producing corrosive
silicon tetrafluoride gas. Cement reacts with water to form silicates and calcium hydroxide. Silicates react with powerful oxidizers
such as fluorine, boron trifluoride, chlorine trifluoride, manganese trifluoride, and oxygen difluoride.
