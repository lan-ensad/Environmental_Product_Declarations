AgileFlow VERTICAL &/OR ARCHITECTURAL

Forming Materials: Forming material shall be steel, aluminum (cured), steel framed plywood, resin
impregnated plywood, plastic or paper faced plywood, or if indicated on the drawings, Plexiglas (of the
grade, size, and thickness indicated). Formwork used for architectural concrete shall be in excellent
condition.

Note: The surface texture and condition of the forming system selected will be directly represented in
the quality of the Agileflow concrete surface.

Recommendations:
e Use formwork of the same quality, same nature, same number of reuses

e  Avoid surfaces that are too smooth or polished. Mat surfaces are preferable to shiny or polished
ones because release agents adhere better

e Cleanthe form / form liner thoroughly after every usage
e  Prevent leakages from formwork and avoid gaps that may open
e  Ensure formworkis sufficiently rigid to prevent deformation
e Be aware that:
- The texture of the formwork may affect the tint of the concrete surface

- New wood forms contain natural sugars that may affect unexpectedly the set time, the tint and
the texture of the surface. In case of using wooden formworks, aged wooden forms prior to
initial use and mock up are strongly recommended.

Demolding agents:

Release agents are often mixtures of oils, additives and solvents. The oil permits the creation of a fatty
film and additives cause a delay of hydration of the concrete surface to create an uncured layer of a few
microns. This effect is observable on the freshly demolded wall through a slightly dusty appearance.

Quality of finish is strongly influenced by the oil used, its viscosity (the lower the viscosity, the better the
quality of finish) and the method of application.

Demolding agents suppliers should be asked for advice and technical specifications of their products.

Curing compound (ASTM C 309):

Selection of a curing compound should be based on 2 criteria: curing efficiency and type of finish to
be applied on the cured surfaces. Both are directly related to the chemistry of the curing compound.
As seen on the below graph, wax-based products are the most efficient products in terms of curing.

But wax-based products also affect the bond between concrete and any adhesive coming later on.
They have to be grinded first to ensure proper adhesion. Acrylic-based products are less efficient in
curing but tend to improve the bond between concrete and adhesive; no grinding required.

The contractor should ask the curing compound supplier for all technical information and requirements.

CONCRETE MIX DESIGN

Self-consolidating Concrete: Agileflow proprietary ready-mix concrete with the following characteristics:

e Maximum water cementitious ratio: The maximum water cementitious ratio is specified by the Design
Project Engineer.

e Air content: Insert air entrainment if the concrete element is required to comply with severe exposure
condition

e Flow: 22into 30in
e  Compressive Strength at 28 days: 3500 psi to 14,000 psi

The general contractor should proceed with producing a mock up section prior to pouring concrete for
the final structure at the beginning of a project. Finally, the owner’s representative (testing agency), will
make cast concrete cylinders or cubic specimens for testing.

EXECUTION

Concrete characteristics are strongly linked to how it is installed. The following chapter describes how to
properly install Agileflow from the base preparation to the care that shall be taken during finishing and
curing to assure the quality of the product.

SITE INSPECTION

Verification of Conditions: Examine areas and conditions under which work is to be performed and
identify conditions detrimental to proper or timely completion.

Do not proceed until unsatisfactory conditions have been corrected.

SITE PREPARATION

Coordination: Notify others involved, allowing installation and completion of their work prior to concrete
placement.

Agileflow VERTICAL and / or ARCHITECTURAL

Formwork Surface Preparation: Based on the final choice of formwork and ambient temperature, Holcim
recommends specific types of release agents. These recommendations should be followed. They have for
objectives to reduce the excessive presence of bubbles on the surface and to help with the homogeneity
of the texture and tint.

HOLCIM

SPECIFICATION SHEET | AGILEFLOW 5

Release agent application:
e Clean formwork thoroughly before applying the release agent

e _ Apply uniformly and remove the excess. Unevenly sprayed release agent will affect the
tint homogeneity

e Avoid exposure to sun, rain and dust in order to retain the performance of the release agent

e Respect waiting time recommendations from the release agent manufacturer

Be careful, an excess of demolding agent will generate bug holes, dusty surfaces and colour variations.
Formwork tightness: Before closing the formwork, make sure that there is no wane or holes bigger than

0.4” in height along the bearing length of the shutters on the support floor. If necessary, fill in the holes
with a material that will stay in place while pouring (polyurethane foam, sealant, etc.).

Openings along the length of the vertical joints, between two elements of the shutters or between the
end of the formwork and a wall already cast should not exceed two millimeters. These vertical holes
should be filled with polyurethane foam.

Pressure on the formwork: Formwork dimensioning should be done by the producer of the shutters. This
is their complete responsibility. In the absence of information obtained from on-site measurements (load
sensors), the calculated pressure should not be below the hydrostatic pressure of the Agileflow concrete.

Pressure reductions depend on the pouring length of time when pouring very high walls, even though
it also depends on the composition and above all on the temperature of the concrete. The Natural
logarithm function of the length of the pouring time in hours can be used to estimate the pressure.

Reduction coefficient R = In (hour duration) (for a minimum of 2 hours of pouring)
Reduced pressure lb/ft2 P = 2.3 x Height / R * 186

Example for a 28ft-high wall - 7 hours pouring time:

in hours pressure coefficient R LN(H) [(L7419) 1 rod per 1.5m°?)

7.0 3753 1.95 1932 31,200 lb

The pressure per ft? of the concrete skin = 1932 lb and on the rods (hypothesis: 1 rod per 16 ft? of surface),
a force of 31,200 lb. The rods should therefore be in, minimum, otherwise it is necessary to increase the
number of rods per ft2.

Surface Preparation: Immediately before concrete placement, thoroughly wet moisture-absorbing
material that will be in contact with concrete, without developing standing water. Ensure that concrete
steel forms and rebars are not steaming hot prior to pouring Agileflow in the formwork. For flat work/slabs,
Agileflow Horizontal can be poured directly on the existing surface if the surface is non absorbent and is
clean (ex: steel deck). In all other case:

Substrate types:
e  Anystable well compacted substrate free of debris

e Surface must be relatively flat with an unevenness level of Less than 13 mm thick for a 1.8 m cross
section (rule)

Preparation:

e _Ifthe concreteis to be placed bonded to a sub-layer, steel reinforcement mesh will be required.
Bonding compounds (such as an SBR type of product) should be applied.

e _Ifthe concreteis to be unbonded, a polyethylene membrane with a minimum thickness of 0.005 in
must be placed over the sub-base (suggested thickness).

- The membrane should be secured and overlapped to ensure no movement and no concrete
leakage through the plastic layer.

-_  Atthe walls, the polyethylene membrane should extend above the level of the pour.
Perimeter isolation:

e  Compressible strips should be fitted around the walls and vertical features such as columns, walls
and duct pipes.

e Take particular care to isolate re-entrant corners at doorways, windows and corner walls as these
could become a source of radial cracking

e Ensure the perimeter isolation is placed at right

e _Compressible strips should be prepared to ensure no movement

e  Ethafoam or polystyrene can be used to seal any holes or Leaks in the form

e Double up the isolation may be necessary on exterior angles to ensure the minimum thickness is
maintained around the angle.

CONCRETE PLACEMENT AND CONSOLIDATION
Agileflow VERTICAL and / or ARCHITECTURAL

Place concrete within 120 minutes of adding the mix water unless our representative has made adjust-
ments to the mix. The truck driver should remix concrete for 3 min prior to discharge. During discharge,
the drum should not remain static more than 2 min; it should be continuously rotated in case of delay.

Placing:

Agileflow is placed via bucket or pumped. In all cases, concrete should not fall from the top ofthe
formwork; a hose should guide it till 4 in from the bottom or the formwork. Free fall will generate bug
holes. Flexible hoses can eventually stay in place; important to note holes have to be created at different
heights to ensure smooth filling and discharge if it stays in place (see picture below). Rigid one have to
be removed before concrete hardens. The pictures below are giving examples of setups. Install the tremie
before closing the formwork when there is an important density of reinforcement.

Pouring points should be positioned so that concrete does not have to flow for more than 7m / 23 ft from
each side of the pouring point. The following diagrams are illustrating different configurations.

The plain wall configuration shown on the first diagram is self-explanatory. With openings, pouring points
have to be used following a specific sequence starting from R1 up to R£.

Other aspects:

e Do not vibrate Agileflow Architectural.

e  Avoid long gaps in placing between lifts to prevent pour lines.

e _lfthe concrete is pumped, the hose of the pump should be immersed in the concrete and raised
with the level of concrete.

°  Ensure pump lines are primed prior to start. Do not allow priming water/grout to be placed in forms.
Pump off concrete until a consistent product is coming out of the line otherwise segregation
may occur.

e _Ifusing buckets, avoid saturating the bucket with a release agent as this can cause segregation or
discoloration. Ensure there is no water in the bucket prior to filling.

e Whatever the placing method used, the flow must be continuous and steady. The speed of pour
should be determined during the pre job meeting and approved by the contractor’s structural
engineer. The speed should be maintained to obtain a consistent surface finish. Pour rates too
slow or too fast may contribute to entrapped air in the concrete.

e  Avoid splashing Agileflow on form walls while placing as these areas could dry quicker and possibly
cause bug holes. It is recommended to leave the hose immersedl.

e For large walls, moving the point of placement frequently may be required depending on flow,
temperature and rate of placement to prevent a pour/lift line.

e  Avoid placing Agileflow Architectural when ambient temperatures exceed 90°F.

e For optimal results, it is important to pour in similar conditions. Cold or warm weather conditions,

time to strip the form, sun and wind, will all be factors which can modify the surface appearance.

Agileflow HORIZONTAL

For flat work/slabs:

When Agileflow Horizontal has been placed to the correct level, the surface should be finished with
an Agileflow finishing bar.

The level of the concrete must be verified by the standard equipment and method as it would be for
regular concrete.

The finishing bar is moved across the surface of the Agileflow concrete, in a motion to generate
gentle waves in both directions at 90° from each other.

First pass should be deeper than the second pass to a maximum depth reaching 34 of the depth of
the finishing bar.

Second pass should be a light motion over the surface.
The minimum thickness recommended will depend on the maximum diameter of the aggregates.

Joints shall be planned following the same rules as for standard concrete. Depth of saw-cut joints
shall be greater than 1/3rd of the slab thickness.

CONCRETE CURING AND PROTECTION

Agileflow HORIZONTAL

Recommendations applicable to Agileflow do not differ from the ones for conventional concrete.
Contractor should protect freshly placed concrete from premature drying and excessive cold or hot
temperatures using an evaporation retarder for “flat work/slabs” covered by these specifications.

A wind barrier is also recommended in case surfaces are exposed to wind.

Curing compound is the preferred curing technique as its application can be done at an early stage.

It should be applied right after the concrete is finished. It should be applied uniformly using a spraying
bottle at the rate specified by the curing compound manufacturer.
