3. Product Description

Usage

TerraCemTM  hydraulic cement is a
building material that is engineered
primarily for use in soil stabilization,
drying, and remediation work. TerraCemT"
hydraulic cement is produced to meet
the applicable requirements of ASTM
C1157 for Type GU cement. The use of
TerraCemT" results in a lower carbon
impact than ASTM C150 Type | cement.

Some cements may meet several
specification requirements. Contact the manufacturer for
details.

Packaging
TerraCemTM hydraulic cement is regionally available and
can be supplied in bulk quantities.

Composition and Materials

The primary ingredients of TerraCem'" hydraulic cement
may include calcium silicate based clinker, limestone,
gypsum and other mineral constituents. There are no
restrictions on the composition of the cement or its
constituents. They are ground to a fine powder that, when
mixed with water, sets and hardens. The hydration of
calcium silicates forms a fiber-like material called calcium
silicate hydrate (CSH).

Al manufacturing is quality controlled to ensure product
conformance.

Types
Type GU hydraulic cement for general construction; used
when 1 or more of the special types are not required.
