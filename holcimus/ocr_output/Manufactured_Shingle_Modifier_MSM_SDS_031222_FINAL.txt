SECTION 4: FIRST AID MEASURES

4.1. Description of First-aid Measures

General: Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. If you feel unwell, seek medical advice (show the label where
possible).

Inhalation: Using proper respiratory protection, move the exposed person to fresh air at once. Encourage exposed person to cough,
spit out, and blow nose to remove dust. Immediately call a poison center, physician, or emergency medical service.

Skin Contact: Remove contaminated clothing. Removal of solidified molten material from skin requires medical assistance. If exposed
or concerned: Get medical advice/attention. Drench affected area with water for at least 15 minutes.

Eye Contact: Rinse cautiously with water for at least 5 minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue rinsing.
Obtain medical attention if irritation develops or persists.

Ingestion: Rinse mouth. Do NOT induce vomiting. Obtain medical attention.

4.2. Most Important Symptoms and Effects Both Acute and Delayed

General: Risk of thermal burns on contact with molten product. Causes damage to organs (lung/respiratory system) through
prolonged or repeated exposure (Inhalation). May cause cancer by inhalation.

Inhalation: Dust may be harmful or cause irritation. Some studies show that exposure to respirable crystalline silica (without
silicosis) or that the disease silicosis may be associated with the increased incidence of several autoimmune disorders such as
scleroderma (thickening of the skin), systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and diseases affecting the kidneys. Silicosis
increases the risk of tuberculosis. Some studies show an increased incidence of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease
in workers exposed to respirable crystalline silica.

Skin Contact: Direct contact may cause irritation by mechanical abrasion.

Eye Contact: May cause mechanical eyeirritation.

Ingestion: Ingestion may cause adverse effects.

Chronic Symptoms: Long term exposure to respirable crystalline silica results in a significant risk of developing silicosis and other
non-malignant respiratory disease, lung cancer, kidney effects, and immune system effects.

4.3. Indication of Any Immediate Medical Attention and Special Treatment Needed

If exposed or concerned, get medical advice and attention. If medical advice is needed, have product container or label at hand.

SECTION 5: FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES

5.1.  Extinguishing Media

Suitable Extinguishing Media: Water spray, dry chemical, foam, carbon dioxide.

Unsuitable Extinguishing Media: Do not use a heavy water stream. Use of heavy stream of water may spread fire.

5.2. Special Hazards Arising From the Substance or Mixture

Fire Hazard: Combustible Dust.

Explosion Hazard: Dust explosion hazard in air.

Reactivity: Hazardous reactions will not occur under normal conditions.

5.3. Advice for Firefighters

Precautionary Measures Fire: Exercise caution when fighting any chemical fire.

Firefighting Instructions: Use water spray or fog for cooling exposed containers.

Protection During Firefighting: Do not enter fire area without proper protective equipment, including respiratory protection.
Hazardous Combustion Products: Carbon oxides (CO, CO2). Hydrogen sulfide. Oxides of magnesium. Silicon oxides. Sulfur oxides.
Other Information: Risk of dust explosion.

5.4. Reference to Other Sections
Refer to Section 9 for flammability properties.

SECTION 6: ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

6.1. Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures

General Measures: Do not handle until all safety precautions have been read and understood. Do not breathe dust. Do not get in
eyes, on skin, or on clothing. Avoid generating dust. Remove ignition sources. Keep away from heat, hot surfaces, sparks, open
flames, and other ignition sources. No smoking.

6.1.1. For Non-Emergency Personnel

Protective Equipment: Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).

Emergency Procedures: Evacuate unnecessary personnel.

6.1.2. For Emergency Personnel

Protective Equipment: Equip cleanup crew with proper protection.

Emergency Procedures: Upon arrival at the scene, a first responder is expected to recognize the presence of dangerous goods,
protect oneself and the public, secure the area, and call for the assistance of trained personnel as soon as conditions permit.
Ventilate area.

6.2. Environmental Precautions

Prevent entry to sewers and public waters.

6.3. Methods and Materials for Containment and Cleaning Up

For Containment: Contain solid spills with appropriate barriers and prevent migration and entry into sewers or streams. Avoid
generation of dust during clean-up of spills.

Methods for Cleaning Up: Use only non-sparking tools. Clean up spills immediately and dispose of waste safely. Use explosion proof
vacuum during cleanup, with appropriate filter. Do not mix with other materials. Vacuum clean-up is preferred. If sweeping is
required use a dust suppressant. Contact competent authorities after a spill.

6.4. Reference to Other Sections

See Section 8 for exposure controls and personal protection and Section 13 for disposal considerations.

SECTION 7: HANDLING AND STORAGE

7.1. Precautions for Safe Handling

Additional Hazards When Processed: Cutting, crushing, sanding or grinding of crystalline silica-bearing materials will release
respirable crystalline silica. Use all appropriate measures of dust control or suppression, and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
described in Section 8 below. Heavy material - proper lifting methods or equipment. May release hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide
is a highly flammable and toxic gas. Gas can accumulate in the headspace of closed containers; use caution when opening sealed
containers. Heating the product or containers can cause thermal decomposition of the product and release hydrogen sulfide.
Accumulation and dispersion of dust with an ignition source can cause a combustible dust explosion. Keep dust levels to a minimum
and follow applicable regulations.

Precautions for Safe Handling: Obtain special instructions before use. Do not handle until all safety precautions have been read and
understood. Wash hands and other exposed areas with mild soap and water before eating, drinking or smoking and when leaving
work. Avoid creating or spreading dust. Do not breathe dust. Avoid contact with eyes, skin and clothing. Keep away from heat,
sparks, open flames, and hot surfaces. No smoking.

Hygiene Measures: Handle in accordance with good industrial hygiene and safety procedures.

7.2. Conditions for Safe Storage, Including Any Incompatibilities

Technical Measures: Comply with applicable regulations. Avoid creating or spreading dust. Use explosion-proof electrical,
ventilating, lighting equipment. Proper grounding procedures to avoid static electricity should be followed.

Storage Conditions: Keep container closed when not in use. Store in a dry, cool place. Keep/Store away from direct sunlight,
extremely high or low temperatures and incompatible materials. Store locked up/in a secure area.

Incompatible Materials: Dissolves in hydrofluoric acid, producing corrosive silicon tetrafluoride gas.

7.3. Specific End Use(s)

MSM"" is used as a modifier for hot mix asphalt.

SECTION 8: EXPOSURE CONTROLS/PERSONAL PROTECTION

8.1. Control Parameters

For substances listed in section 3 that are not listed here, there are no established exposure limits from the manufacturer, supplier,
