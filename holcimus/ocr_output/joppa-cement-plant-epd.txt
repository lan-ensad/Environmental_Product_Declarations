Product Definition Portland cement is defined as a hydraulic cement produced by pulverizing
clinker, consisting essentially of crystalline hydraulic calcium silicates, and
usually containing one or more of the following: water, calcium sulfate, up to
5% limestone, and processing additions (NSF PCR 2020, ASTM C150, ASTM
C219).

Portland Cement Type I—For use when the special properties specified for
any other type are not required.

Portland Cement Type II--For general use, more especially when moderate
sulfate resistance is desired.

Some cements are designated with a combined type classification, such as
Type [/Il, indicating that the cement meets the requirements of the indicated
types and is being offered as suitable for use when either type is desired.

Blended cement is a hydraulic cement consisting of two or more inorganic
constituents (at least one of which is not Portland cement or Portland cement
clinker) which separately or in combination contribute to the strength gaining
properties of the cement, (made with or without other constituents, processing
additions and functional additions, by intergrinding or other blending (ASTM
C595).

Cement, oil well is either Portland or blended cement mixed with water and
additives to form a slurry to be used for oil-well grouting. Well cement shall be
specified using classes À, B, C, D, G, H, K and L and the grades: ordinary (O),
moderate sulfate-resistant (MSR) and high sulphate-resistant (HSR). (API
specification 10A).

e  Personnel-related activities (travel, furniture, and office supplies)

e Energy and water use related to company management and sales activities that may be located either within
the factory site or at another location

Cut-off Criteria

The cut-off criteria as per NSF PCR, Section 7.1.8 [2] and ISO 21930, 7.1.8 [3] were followed. Per ISO 21930, 7.1.8
[3], all input/output data required were collected and included in the LCI modelling. No substances with hazardous
and toxic properties that pose a concern for human health and/or the environment were identified in the framework of
this EPD. Any plant specific data gaps for the reference year 2019 (e.g., amounts of lubricants and refractory) were
filled in with industry data (secondary data).

Data Collection

Gate-to-gate input/output flow data were collected for the following processes for the reference year 2019:
e _Limestone quarry, clinker production and cement manufacture — Joppa, IL.

Allocation Rules

Allocation follows the requirements and guidance of ISO 14044 Clause 4.3.4 [5], NSF PCR [2], and ISO 21930
section 7.2 [3]. Recycling and recycled content are modeled using the cut-off rule. The sub-category PCR recognizes
fly ash, furnace bottom ash, bypass dust, mill scale, polluted soils, spent catalyst, aluminum oxide waste, silica fume,
granulated blast furnace slag, iron rich waste, cement kiln dust (CKD), flue gas desulfurization (FGD) gypsum, and
calcium fluoride rich waste as recovered materials and thus the environmental impacts allocated to these materials
are limited to the treatment and transportation required to use as a cement material input. Further, used tires,
plastics, solvents, used oil and oily waste, coal/carbon waste, roofing asphalt, household refuse-derived waste and
non-hazardous liquid waste are considered non-renewable and/or renewable secondary fuels. Only the materials,
water, energy, emissions, and other elemental flows associated with reprocessing, handling, sorting and
transportation from the point of the generating industrial process to their use in the production process are
considered. All emissions from combustion at the point of use are considered.

Activity (primary) data are representative of 2019 calendar year (12 months).

- Joppa limestone extraction,

- Joppa clinker production,

- Joppa cement manufacturing,

- In-bound/out-bound transportation data - primary data collected for Joppa quarry site and cement
manufacturing plant.

- Generic data: the most appropriate LCI datasets were used as found in the ecoinvent v.3.6 database for
US and global, December 2019 and US LCI Database.

Electricity resource mix for SERC region includes (eGRID 2018): 29.2% coal, 0.6% oil, 37.2% natural gas,
25.5% nuclear, 3.6% hydro, 2.2% biomass, 0.4% wind, 0.9% solar, and 0.4% other fossils [14], [10].

Time Coverage

Temporal representativeness is characterized as “high”.

All relevant, specific processes, including inputs (raw materials, energy and ancillary materials) and outputs
(emissions and production volume) were considered and modeled to complete production profile for Joppa
cement products.

Completeness The relevant background materials and processes were taken from the US LCI Database (adjusted for

known data placeholders), ecoinvent v 3.6 LCI database for US, and modeled in SimaPro software v.9.1.1.1,
September 2020. The completeness of the cradle-to-gate process chain in terms of process steps is
rigorously assessed for all cement product systems.

To ensure consistency, the LCI modeling of the production input and output LCI data for the Joppa cement
products of interest used the same LCI modeling structure, which consisted of input material and
intermediate products, ancillary and packaging materials (if applicable), energy flows, water resource inputs,
product outputs, co-products, by-products, emissions to air, water and soil, and solid and liquid waste
disposal. Crosschecks concerning the plausibility of mass and energy flows were continuously conducted.
The LCA team conducted mass and energy balances at the facility level and selected process levels to
maintain a high level of consistency.

Consistency

Internal reproducibility is possible since the data and the models are stored and available in LH Joppa
Athena LCI database developed in SimaPro, 2020. A high level of transparency is provided throughout the
Reproducibility report as the LCI profile is presented for each of the declared products as well as major upstream inputs.
Key primary (manufacturer specific) and secondary (generic) LCI data sources are also summarized in the
background report. External reproducibility is not possible as the background report is confidential.

Transparency Activity and LCI datasets are disclosed in the project report, including all data sources.

A sensitivity check was conducted to assess the reliability of the EPD results and conclusions by determining
Uncertainty how they are affected by uncertainties in the data or assumptions on calculation of LCIA and energy indicator
results.

Life Cycle Impact Assessment Results: Joppa, IL Cements

This section summarizes the production stage life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) results including resource use and
waste generated metrics based on the cradle-to-gate life cycle inventory inputs and outputs analysis. The results are
calculated based on 1 metric ton of each cement type as produced at the Joppa, IL plant. ft should be noted that
LCIA results are relative expressions and do not predict impacts on category endpoints, the exceeding of thresholds,
safety margins or risks [4], [5]. Further, a number of LCA impact categories and inventory items are still emerging or
under development and can have high levels of uncertainty that preclude international acceptance pending further
development. Use caution when interpreting results for these categories — identified with an “*’ [2].

Only EPDSs prepared from cradle-to-grave life-cycle results and based on the same function, quantified by the same
functional unit, and taking account of replacement based on the product reference service life (RSL) relative to an
assumed building service life, can be used to assist purchasers and users in making informed comparisons between
products [2]. Environmental declarations from different programs may not be comparable [7]. EPDs are comparable
only if they comply with ISO 21930, use the same, sub-category PCR where applicable, include all relevant
information modules and are based on equivalent scenarios with respect to the context of construction works [3].

LCA Interpretation

The Manufacturing module (A3) drives most of the potential environmental impacts. Manufacturing impacts are
primarily driven by energy use (electricity and thermal fuels) used during the pyroprocessing of limestone in the
production of clinker. Clinker content in cement similarly defines the relative environmental profile of the final cement
product. Raw material extraction (A1) is the second largest contributor to the Production stage EPD results, followed
by the transportation (A2).

Additional Environmental Information
