3. Product Description

Usage

Coal ash (including fly ash) is a pre-
consumer recycled material which can
be used in a wide variety of applications
including concrete construction. The
use of coal ash as a partial replacement
of cementitious materials can result in
stronger, more durable concrete.

Coal ash can also be used to improve concrete workability,
decrease permeability, reduce sulfate attack, enhance
bleeding and segregation, reduce shrinkage, reduce heat
of hydration, increase compressive strength and increase
flexural strength.Coal ashis suitable for a variety of concrete
construction applications from general construction to
dams, piers, massive mat placements, footings and similar
structures.

Uses include:

Bridges # Precast
# Cast-in-place # Pre-stress or post-tension
# Concrete Masonry Units = Ready-mix
(CMU) s Roads
# Drains # Soil Stabilization
s Grout ms Tilt-Up
# Masonry = Watertanks
= Pipe
Packaging

Coal ash (including fly ash) is regionally available and can
be supplied in bulk quantities.

Composition and Materials

Coal ash can be various shades of brown or gray in color,
depending on the type of coal source. lt is primarily silicate
glass containing silica, alumina, iron and calcium. Minor
constituents are magnesium, sulfur, sodium, potassium
and carbon. Chemical composition of coal ash varies
widely.

Coal ash is the by-product of the combustion of pulverized
coalatpowergenerating plants.Exactchemicalcomposition
of coal ash is largely determined by the coal used. Upon
ignition in the furnace, most of the volatile matter and
carbon in the coal are burned off. During combustion, the
coals mineral constituents (such as clay, feldspar, quartz
and shale) fuse in suspension and are carried away from the
combustion chamber by the exhaust gas.

The fused material cools and solidifies into spherical
particles called coal ash or fly ash. This is then collected
from the exhaust gas by electrostatic precipitators or bag
filters. The coal ash collected from exhaust gases needs no
further processing for use in blended cement or concrete.

Most particles of coal ash are spherical. The particle size of
coal ash varies from one micron to as large as 100 microns
(typical particle size is under 20 microns). Specific gravity
can range between 2.2 and 2.8, depending on the type of
coal ash.

Types
Coal ash is categorized by ASTM C618 and AASHTO M 295
as either Class C or Class F.

Benefits

Coal ash is a versatile building material that is suitable for
a variety of concrete construction applications. To achieve
these and other special properties, particular care is needed
when proportioning, batching, placing, finishing and curing
concrete containing these products.

Limitations

There are many variables that affect concrete performance
beyond the control of the cement manufacturer. Good
concreting practices are required in order to achieve desired
results. Attention must be given to formwork, batching,
mixing, placing, finishing and curing.In specialapplications,
selection of aggregates, admixtures and additives may
need to be scrutinized. Holcim (US) Inc. recommends that
all concrete mix proportions be evaluated for acceptable
performance prior to use.

4. Technical Data

Applicable Standards
Produced in accordance with:

# ASTM C618 Standard Specification for Coal Ash and
Raw or Calcined Natural Pozzolan for Use in Concrete

#s AASHTO M 295 Standard Specification for Coal, Fly
Ash and Raw or Calcined Natural Pozzolan for Use in
Concrete

Physical / Chemical Properties

Coal ashes are manufactured to conform to all applicable
requirements for the designated class of ASTM C618 and
AASHTO M 295.

5. Installation

Requirements

For best practices in utilizing coal ash, consult application
specifications and guides as available from the American
Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM), American Concrete
Institute (ACI), American Coal Ash Association (ACAA) or
other reputable industry organization.

Methods

Concrete is a material that includes several constituents
such as cement, aggregate (usually sand and gravel), water,
and admixtures. Freshly mixed concrete should generally
be plastic or semi-fluid and moldable.

Good concreting practices are required for durable and
strong concrete. Proper proportioning, batching, mixing,
placing, consolidating, finishing and curing, as well as
proper subgrade preparation, formwork, uniform slump,
special techniques and other steps are all critical to
achieving the desired results.

The character of concrete is largely determined by the
water-cement ratio (w/c), and is especially critical to a
durable, strong concrete. Freshly mixed (plastic) and
hardened properties of concrete can be enhanced by
adding supplementary cementitious materials (SCM's)
or admixtures during batching. Admixtures may be used
to adjust setting time and/or hardening, reduce water
demand, increase workability, entrain air, improve cost-
effectiveness or other properties.

Safety Precautions

Refer to the applicable Safety Data Sheet (SDS), which
should be consulted prior to the use of this product. These
SDS's are available at www.holcim.us.

Avoid direct contact with the skin. If contact occurs, wash
skin with water as soon as possible. Proper PPE is always
required.
