construction, such as above-grade walls and stucco.
Type S is used in construction where strong lateral and
compressive forces are anticipated. It is most commonly
used in commercial construction, stone masonry and
exterior stucco. Type Mis suited for foundations, manholes
and other extreme moisture and freeze-thaw environments.

5. Installation

Preparatory Work

Cement-Lime blends should be mixed according to ASTM
C270. Machine mixing is highly recommended. Mixing
instructions are printed on each bag and shown below:

# Use 1 bag Cement-Lime to 2-1/4 to 3 parts damp loose
sand by volume. Sand requirements are outlined in
ASTM C144.

Batching Sequence:

# First add approximately 3/4 of the desired volume of
mix water; then add 1/2 the sand followed by 1 bag of
Cement-Lime to the mixer.

# Finally, add the rest of the sand and remaining mix
water sufficient to achieve the desired field workability.

s The combined materials should be mixed 3-5 minutes
after all materials are in the mixer.

Precautions

# Never change sand sources or mortar mixture
proportion volumes during the project; undesirable
color changes and performance changes to the finished
product could result.

# Holcim (US) Inc. does not recommend the use of any
other additives or admixtures.

# Tool all joints to the same degree of firmness in a
uniform consistent manner.

# Avoid excessive re-tempering, which could result in
color variations.

# Protect masonry units from weather before and after
they are set in place.

# Holcim (US) Inc. does not recommend the use of acid-
based cleaning solutions.

# To verify finished appearance, Holcim (US) Inc. always
recommends that a job specific sample panel be
erected; using the same sand, masonry units and
construction practice used on your project.

Safety Precautions

Refer to the applicable Safety Data Sheet (SDS), which
should be consulted prior to the use of this product. These
SDS's are available at www.holcim.us.

Avoid direct contact with the skin. If contact occurs, wash
skin with water as soon as possible. Exposure of sufficient
duration to Cement-Lime can cause serious and potentially
irreversible tissue destruction in the form of chemical burns.
If Cement-Lime gets into the eyes, immediately flush eyes
thoroughly with water and seek medical attention. Proper
PPE is always required.

Storage and Handling

Packaged Cement-Lime blends needing to be temporarily
stored on construction sites should be stored above
the ground on pallets or other means that allow airflow
between the ground and the stored packaged material.
Tarps or polyethylene sheeting should cover the material
when not in use to prevent moisture, precipitation or high
humidity from coming in contact with the bags. Prevent
storage directly against walls or other structures and allow
pallets to have an adequate space to allow for air circulation
to reduce moisture accumulations. Construction sites and
weather conditions vary and further measures may be
required to protect products from moisture.
