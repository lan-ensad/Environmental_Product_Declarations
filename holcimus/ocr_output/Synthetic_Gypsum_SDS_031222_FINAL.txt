4.1. Description of First-aid Measures

General: Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. If you feel unwell, seek medical advice (show the label where
possible).

Inhalation: When symptoms occur: go into open air and ventilate suspected area. Obtain medical attention if breathing difficulty
persists.

Skin Contact: Immediately drench affected area with water for at least 15 minutes. Remove contaminated clothing. If exposed or
concerned: Get medical advice/attention.

Eye Contact: Immediately rinse with water for at least 30 minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue
rinsing. Get immediate medical advice/attention.

Ingestion: Rinse mouth. Do NOT induce vomiting. Obtain medical attention.

4.2. Most Important Symptoms and Effects Both Acute and Delayed

General: Causes serious eye damage. Causes damage to organs (lung/respiratory system) through prolonged or repeated exposure
(Inhalation). May cause cancer by inhalation.

Inhalation: Prolonged exposure may cause irritation. Some studies show that exposure to respirable crystalline silica (without
silicosis) or that the disease silicosis may be associated with the increased incidence of several autoimmune disorders such as
scleroderma (thickening of the skin), systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and diseases affecting the kidneys. Silicosis
increases the risk of tuberculosis. Some studies show an increased incidence of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease
in workers exposed to respirable crystalline silica.

Skin Contact: Prolonged exposure may cause skin irritation.

Eye Contact: Causes permanent damage to the cornea, iris, or conjunctiva.

Ingestion: Ingestion may cause adverse effects.

Chronic Symptoms: Long term exposure to respirable crystalline silica results in a significant risk of developing silicosis and other
non-malignant respiratory disease, lung cancer, kidney effects, and immune system effects.

4.3. Indication of Any Immediate Medical Attention and Special Treatment Needed

If exposed or concerned, get medical advice and attention. If medical advice is needed, have product container or label at hand.

SECTION 5: FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES

5.1.  Extinguishing Media

Suitable Extinguishing Media: Water spray, dry chemical, foam, carbon dioxide.

Unsuitable Extinguishing Media: Do not use a heavy water stream. Use of heavy stream of water may spread fire.

5.2. Special Hazards Arising From the Substance or Mixture

Fire Hazard: Not considered flammable but may burn at high temperatures.

Explosion Hazard: Product is not explosive.

Reactivity: Hazardous reactions will not occur under normal conditions.

5.3. Advice for Firefighters

Precautionary Measures Fire: Exercise caution when fighting any chemical fire.

Firefighting Instructions: Use water spray or fog for cooling exposed containers.

Protection During Firefighting: Do not enter fire area without proper protective equipment, including respiratory protection.
Hazardous Combustion Products: Calcium oxides. Carbon oxides (CO, CO). Oxides of magnesium. Silicon oxides. Sulfur oxides.
5.4. Reference to Other Sections

Refer to Section 9 for flammability properties.

SECTION 6: ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

6.1. Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures

eyes, on skin, or on clothing.

6.1.1. For Non-Emergency Personnel

Protective Equipment: Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).

Emergency Procedures: Evacuate unnecessary personnel.

6.1.2. For Emergency Personnel

Protective Equipment: Equip cleanup crew with proper protection.

Emergency Procedures: Upon arrival at the scene, a first responder is expected to recognize the presence of dangerous goods,
protect oneself and the public, secure the area, and call for the assistance of trained personnel as soon as conditions permit.
Ventilate area.

6.2. Environmental Precautions

Prevent entry to sewers and public waters.

6.3. Methods and Materials for Containment and Cleaning Up

For Containment: Contain solid spills with appropriate barriers and prevent migration and entry into sewers or streams.
Methods for Cleaning Up: Clean up spills immediately and dispose of waste safely. Recover the product by vacuuming, shoveling or
sweeping. Transfer spilled material to a suitable container for disposal. Contact competent authorities after a spill.

SECTION 7: HANDLING AND STORAGE

7.1. Precautions for Safe Handling

Additional Hazards When Processed: Cutting, crushing or grinding crystalline silica-bearing materials may release respirable
crystalline silica, a known carcinogen. Use all appropriate measures of dust control or suppression and Personal Protective.
Precautions for Safe Handling: Obtain special instructions before use. Do not handle until all safety precautions have been read and
understood. Wash hands and other exposed areas with mild soap and water before eating, drinking or smoking and when leaving
work. Do not get in eyes, on skin, or on clothing. Do not breathe dust.

Hygiene Measures: Handle in accordance with good industrial hygiene and safety procedures.

7.2. Conditions for Safe Storage, Including Any Incompatibilities

Technical Measures: Comply with applicable regulations.

Storage Conditions: Keep container closed when not in use. Keep/Store away from direct sunlight, extremely high or low
temperatures and incompatible materials. Store locked up/in a secure area. Handle with care and use appropriate control measures.
Keep bulk gypsum dry until used.

Engulfment hazard. To prevent burial or suffocation, do not enter a confined space, such as a silo, bin, bulk truck, or other storage
container or vessel that stores or contains gypsum. Gypsum can buildup or adhere to the walls of a confined space. The gypsum can
release, collapse or fall unexpectedly. Do not stand on stockpiles of gypsum, they may be unstable. Use engineering controls (e.g.
wetting stockpiles) to prevent windblown dust from stockpiles, which may cause the hazards described in Section 3.

Incompatible Materials: Strong acids, strong bases, strong oxidizers. Dissolves in hydrofluoric acid, producing corrosive silicon
tetrafluoride gas.

Storage Temperature: Unlimited

7.3. Specific End Use(s)

Synthetic gypsum is used in the manufacturing of drywall, drywall compounds, cement, concrete and concrete products.
