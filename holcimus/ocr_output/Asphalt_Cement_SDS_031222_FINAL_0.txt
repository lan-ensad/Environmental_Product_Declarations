SECTION 4: FIRST AID MEASURES

4.1. Description of First-aid Measures

General: Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. If you feel unwell, seek medical advice (show the label where
possible).

Inhalation: When symptoms occur: go into open air and ventilate suspected area. Obtain medical attention if breathing difficulty
persists.

Skin Contact: Remove contaminated clothing. Removal of solidified molten material from skin requires medical assistance. Drench
affected area with water for at least 5 minutes. If exposed or concerned: Get medical advice/attention.

Eye Contact: Removal of solidified molten material from the eyes requires medical assistance. Rinse cautiously with water for at least
5 minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue rinsing. Obtain medical attention if irritation develops or
persists.

Ingestion: Rinse mouth. Do NOT induce vomiting. Obtain medical attention.

4.2. Most Important Symptoms and Effects Both Acute and Delayed

General: This product, if heated may release asphalt fumes. During processing, inhalation of fumes may cause dizziness and/or
irritation to the eyes, nose, and throat. Hot molten product will cause thermal burns to the skin. Suspected of causing cancer.

Asphalt Cement (Asphalt)

Safety Data Sheet
According To Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 58 / Monday, March 26, 2012 / Rules And Regulations And According To The Hazardous Products Regulation (February 11, 2015).

Inhalation: Toxic fumes may be generated from heating asphalt and may be harmful if inhaled. WARNING: irritating and toxic
hydrogen sulfide gas may be present. Greater than 15-20ppm continuous exposure can cause mucous membrane and respiratory
tract irritation. 50-500 ppm can cause headache, nausea, and dizziness. Continued exposure at these levels can lead to loss of
reasoning and balance, difficulty in breathing, fluid in the lungs, and possible loss of consciousness. Greater than 500ppm can cause
rapid unconsciousness and death if not promptly revived. Hydrogen sulfide may cause respiratory paralysis. Prolonged exposure
may causeirritation.

Skin Contact: Prolonged exposure may cause skinirritation. Risk of thermal burns on contact with molten product.

Eye Contact: May cause slight irritation to eyes. Risk of thermal burns on contact with molten product.

Ingestion: Ingestion may cause adverse effects.

Chronic Symptoms: Emissions from asphalt are suspected of causing cancer. If dust is generated, repeated exposure through
inhalation may cause cancer or lung disease. Symptoms will include progressively more difficult breathing, cough, fever, and weight
loss.

4.3. Indication of Any Immediate Medical Attention and Special Treatment Needed
If exposed or concerned, get medical advice and attention. If medical advice is needed, have product container or label at hand.

SECTION 5: FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES

5.1.  Extinguishing Media

Suitable Extinguishing Media: Water spray, dry chemical, foam, carbon dioxide.

Unsuitable Extinguishing Media: Do not use water when molten material is involved, may react violently or explosively on contact
with water. Do not use a heavy water stream. Use of heavy stream of water may spread fire.

5.2. Special Hazards Arising From the Substance or Mixture

Fire Hazard: Not considered flammable but may burn at high temperatures.

Explosion Hazard: In molten state: reacts violently with water (moisture).

Reactivity: Hazardous reactions will not occur under normal conditions.

5.3. Advice for Firefighters

Precautionary Measures Fire: Exercise caution when fighting any chemical fire.

Firefighting Instructions: Use water spray or fog for cooling exposed containers.

Protection During Firefighting: Do not enter fire area without proper protective equipment, including respiratory protection.
Hazardous Combustion Products: Carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, smoke, fumes, unburned hydrocarbons and oxides of sulfur
and/or nitrogen. Hydrogen sulfide and other sulfur-containing gases can evolve from this product particularly at elevated
temperatures.

5.4. Reference to Other Sections

Refer to Section 9 for flammability properties.

SECTION 6: ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

6.1. Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures

General Measures: Do not get in eyes, on skin, or on clothing. Do not breathe dust.

6.1.1. For Non-Emergency Personnel

Protective Equipment: Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).

Emergency Procedures: Evacuate unnecessary personnel.

6.1.2. For Emergency Personnel

Protective Equipment: Equip cleanup crew with proper protection.

Emergency Procedures: Upon arrival at the scene, a first responder is expected to recognize the presence of dangerous goods,
protect oneself and the public, secure the area, and call for the assistance of trained personnel as soon as conditions permit.
Ventilate area.

6.2. Environmental Precautions

Prevent entry to sewers and public waters.

6.3. Methods and Materials for Containment and Cleaning Up

For Containment: Contain solid spills with appropriate barriers and prevent migration and entry into sewers or streams.
Methods for Cleaning Up: Clean up spills immediately and dispose of waste safely. Recover the product by vacuuming, shoveling or
sweeping. Transfer spilled material to a suitable container for disposal. Contact competent authorities after a spill.

6.4. Reference to Other Sections

SECTION 7: HANDLING AND STORAGE

7.1. Precautions for Safe Handling

Additional Hazards When Processed: If stored under heat for extended periods or significantly agitated, this material might evolve
or release hydrogen sulfide, a flammable gas, which can raise and widen this material's actual flammability limits and significantly
lower its auto-ignition temperature. Hydrogen sulfide is a toxic gas that can be fatal. It also has a rotten egg smell that causes odor
fatigue very quickly and shouldn't be used as an indicator for the presence of gas.

Precautions for Safe Handling: Obtain special instructions before use. Do not handle until all safety precautions have been read and
understood. Do not get in eyes, on skin, or on clothing. Do not breathe dust. Wash hands and other exposed areas with mild soap
and water before eating, drinking or smoking and when leaving work.

Hygiene Measures: Handle in accordance with good industrial hygiene and safety procedures.

7.2. Conditions for Safe Storage, Including Any Incompatibilities

Technical Measures: Comply with applicable regulations.

Storage Conditions: Keep container closed when not in use. Store in a dry, cool place. Keep/Store away from direct sunlight,
extremely high or low temperatures and incompatible materials. Store locked up/in a secure area.

Incompatible Materials: Strong acids, strong bases, strong oxidizers. Fluorine.

Storage Temperature: Unlimited

7.3. Specific End Use(s)

HMA is used for paving roads, driveways, parking lots and other surface, base, or sub-base applications.
