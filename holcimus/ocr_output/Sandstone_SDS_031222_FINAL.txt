SECTION 4: FIRST AID MEASURES

4.1. Description of First-aid Measures
General: Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. If you feel unwell, seek medical advice (show the label where
possible).
Inhalation: When symptoms occur: go into open air and ventilate suspected area. Obtain medical attention if breathing difficulty
persists.
Skin Contact: Remove contaminated clothing. Drench affected area with water for at least 15 minutes. If exposed or concerned: Get
medical advice/attention.
Eye Contact: Rinse cautiously with water for at least 5 minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present and easy to do. Continue rinsing.
Obtain medical attention if irritation develops or persists.
Ingestion: Rinse mouth. Do NOT induce vomiting. Obtain medical attention.
4.2. Most Important Symptoms and Effects Both Acute and Delayed
General: May cause respiratory irritation. Causes damage to organs (lung/respiratory system) (Inhalation). May cause cancer by
inhalation.
Inhalation: irritation of the respiratory tract and the other mucous membranes. Some studies show that exposure to respirable
crystalline silica (without silicosis) or that the disease silicosis may be associated with the increased incidence of several
autoimmune disorders such as scleroderma (thickening of the skin), systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and
diseases affecting the kidneys. Silicosis increases the risk of tuberculosis. Some studies show an increased incidence of chronic
kidney disease and end-stage renal disease in workers exposed to respirable crystalline silica.
Skin Contact: Skin contact with large amounts of dust may cause mechanical irritation.

Eye Contact: Eye contact with dust may cause mechanical irritation.
Ingestion: Ingestion may cause adverse effects.
Chronic Symptoms: Long term exposure to respirable crystalline silica results in a significant risk of developing silicosis and other
non-malignant respiratory disease, lung cancer, kidney effects, and immune system effects.
4.3. Indication of Any Immediate Medical Attention and Special Treatment Needed
If exposed or concerned, get medical advice and attention. If medical advice is needed, have product container or label at hand.

6.4. Reference to Other Sections
See Section 8 for exposure controls and personal protection and Section 13 for disposal considerations.

SECTION 7: HANDLING AND STORAGE

7.1. Precautions for Safe Handling
Additional Hazards When Processed: Stack bagged material in a secure manner to prevent falling. Bagged aggregate is heavy and
poses risks such as sprains and strains to the back, arms, shoulders and legs during lifting and mixing. Handle with care and use
appropriate control measures. Cutting, crushing or grinding crystalline silica-bearing materials may release respirable crystalline
silica, a known carcinogen. Use all appropriate measures of dust control or suppression and Personal Protective.
Precautions for Safe Handling: Obtain special instructions before use. Do not handle until all safety precautions have been read and
understood. Avoid contact with eyes, skin and clothing. Do not breathe dust. Wash hands and other exposed areas with mild soap
and water before eating, drinking or smoking and when leaving work.
